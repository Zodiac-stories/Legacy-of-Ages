  
It's been so long since I've been free to change, without splitting, since the incident with my ex-roommate I've stayed in one skin, no back and forth transformations, it's easier being a girl anyway, and there are more perks, niggas buy you shit, and let you get away with murder. A little background, I'm a shifter my name is Jacob aka Jake I'm a child of magic and I can transform, some can transform into animals, mystical creatures, I only change genders. 

No big, but it keeps getting me into shit, I had an ex-bf who wanted to fight me after he found out saying I tricked him and how he aint into that hommo shit and ex-friends who thought I used my female form to check out other women after this last stunt I.......... lemme show you why I fucking skipped continents. 

This here is Shaunua, my once-upon-a-time bestie, I thought we \-were thick as thieves, my day one rider until one day I was going through my monthly lol seeeeee, even though I can change  on demand once a month instead of a period I revert to a male .-. days no ability to change back I was coming to the end of this month when.  
Shaunua: Jackie, where you at wait till you hear this shit\!\!\!

Shaunua: Oh I'm sorry I wasn't aware she had company sorry  
Jake: welp cats out of the bag, but girl it's me   
Shaunua: huh?  
Jake: it's me, Jackie, Remember I told you I was a shifter  
Shaunua: Wait you turn into a nigga?  
Jake: Yea, But please don't say any stupid shit like am I using my girl form to perve on you, cause I'm not.

Shaunua: And why the fuck not whats wrong with me?  
Jake: Nigga what?  
Shaunua: what I'm not your type or something, oh shit my bad you be taking dick as a woman you prob don't even like girls sorry, that was insensitive as fuck.

Jackie: Nana you playing right?  
Shaunua: holy SHIT WHOA, you wasn't playing that was wild no smoke and mirrors just blink titties, FUCK.  
Jackie: yeah, trippy.  
Shaunua: but bitch you fine, why you gotta be gay?  
Jackie: I'm not

Shaunua: have you not realized yet, I mean you, woman you, if you don't fuck women but I know you fuck niggas as a girl that makes you gay my nigga.  
Jackie: Jake fucks women  
Shaunua: wait but he just said  
Jackie: we aint really get to say shit you was here making your own assumtions

Shaunua: Wait, wait, wait, WAIT so you do fuck bitches?  
Jackie: As Jake yes I enjoy it, when I'm in a relationship, still a demisexual, no matter what form  
Shaunua: Fuck that don't give me that bullshit, how many fucking times have I cried on your shoulder about shitty niggas and you was a nigga all along a fine nigga too You coulda been cracking my shit

Jackie: I'm not doing this with you right now.  
Shaunua: the fuck you not you mad fucking fake and this a wild fucking way to find out.  
Jackie: .............. Are you really serious about this  
Shaunua: Yes I'm serious, oh you gonna hide behind ya demi flag ok, was I not good enough to date you swear I was the bestie, tell me all my niggas is stupid cause I'm wife material so why YOU aint wife me, was you ashamed a something? is ya dick little? like what's up 

I was at a loss like this my best friend flipping cause I didn't want to fuck her and NO LIKE SHE REALLY SERIOUS RIGHT NOW.  
Jackie: So your hang-up right now is me not fucking you, I'm a bad friend because I didn't want to potentially ruin our friendship by fucking my friend, because I saw you as a friend and not a partner?

Shaunua: the only female friend a nigga got he don't wanna fuck is an ugly bitch and I'm far from that so lets get to the bottom of it, are you jealous of me?  
Jackie: Excuse me?  
Shaunua: nah fess up, you jealous of me cause I'm a pretty little bitch, I shoulda known you shift into a nigga with that build and them shoulders, you scared if you fuck me you not gonna be okay with ya female self again?

I didn't even say goodbye, went to the rental office paid up my half of the rent for the rest of the year took my name off the lease, and bought a plane ticket to North America,  So here I am it's been . years since that nightmare I'm settled I been practicing separation magic, splitting myself into two, It's exactly as painful as it sounds, but lifes been a little easier pretending I'm just a twin.

So Here I is, it's that time of the month and wouldn't you know it that morning wood asking to be handled, I'm the type of nigga I'm not gonna lock doors in my house, this my house I pay the bills I can do the fuck I want, like give my new friend who acts like she pays the bills an extra set of keys. 

Y'all meet Malory, the new bestie she Sweetness reincarnated, she is bout to walk in on her best friend's Twin brother about to beat it in her best friend's bed lol this is going to be fun. let's go.

Jake: Real talk, I want to make sure what we have isn't just physical I've walked into sex-first relationships and the passion was the high we were chasing but everything else wasn't there, you look and smell so fucking good and you taste even better, I haven't even gotten to indulge and I'm craving so I want to make sure I can be hooked on more than just your body.  
Mallory:.............so you do want more like, you're not looking for just a hookup?

River: the only father my son has, is our father in heaven, he was a gift, and I would appreciate you to stop bringing up his conception every time I bring up you dressing like the whore of Babylon, yes some men are filthy animals, and it won't matter what you wear  
Alize: all men who rape women are filthy Animals  
River: Do what you want Zae, I can't protect you from you 

Alize: River I don't need you to protect me, I stay strapped at All times don't you worry, you the one that needs protection Miss Holier than though  
River: I don't think I'm Holier than anyone I just try to live my life in a way that's pleasing to god cause I know he has my back.  
Alize: He ain't have ya back that night he let you get stuck outside in the cold and them niggas took turns on you, where was ya god then, sis you so fucking sexy, if you would just own that sexuality and live a little. 

River: I am very Alive BECAUSE of my god, that night those devils were ready to kill me my god sent his Angel to stop them, when I looked up from that floor batter and broken I saw the Angel Michael, I could have been diagnosed with all types of forever diseases but my god gave me a clean bill of health, he also gave me a beautiful baby boy, who I named after my rescuing Angel, god works in very mysterious ways I don't presume to know all I'm no prophet but my babies here for a reason.

Alize: I miss you and I know you miss me so I thought we could put the whole silly thing behind us and reconcile our issues|  
Jake: our issue was you were fucking your landlord so you didn't have to pay rent, I start paying your rent for you cause you know what are good boyfriends for, you continue to fuck your landlord.

I've got something far better than just a banging body on my arm now and you are not worth losing her.

Mike: come on you not dead ass  
Will: Very, you killed . humans, un-provoked  
Mike: Un-provoked no fucking way, they were going to kill her  
Will: she was one of them, therefore it was a human problem, you dragged us in it by going full beasty and ripping them to threads


Mike: This was over a year ago the Elder gods aint even budged in my direction so why is the council on my ass  
Will: You know Thalos he's always thinking they up to something  
Mike: ok sooooooo, what does he want, he can't be on ya ass without trying to dick you so whats up   
Will: he wants you to kill her  
Mike: WHATT\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!  
Will: he says maybe we can play it off like you were hunting her for a min and they interfered with your hunt so your beast killed them.

Caleb: I mean it makes sense  
Mike NO and I'm not fucking doing it, you didn't see her, you didn't hear her screams I could barely control myself enough to change back and get her some help..I......I  
Caleb: calm down little pup, don't go changing on me, what if she's your Mate  
Mike/Will: WHATT\!\!\!\!\!\!\!  
Caleb: hear me out we watch humans do unspeakable things to each other on a daily basis, when have you ever felt a need to step in so overwhelming you ripped . grown huge men apart?? The newspapers said A pack of wild Animals HAHA not one A PACK, when have you ever reacted so strongly  
Will: No


Mike: Doubtful, the fuck you saying no for  
Will: She's human right a full-blooded one at that, we got enough shit on our plate than to add you mated to a full-blooded human  
Caleb: but my dear and oldest friend this would very much solve All of those problems, or do you believe you are the only one worthy to be mated  
Will: Fuck you  
Mike: not just one mate too this nigga got TWO HA


Will: Ya'll comedians? we got Charlie Murphey jr and Paul Mooney  
Caleb: always Wanted to be a Comedian  
Will: I can tell  
Caleb: but I'm not wrong and you know it, if they were mated he would be absolved he protected his future mate   
Mike: Failed, I failed to protect her they raped her, they HURT her  
Caleb: calm down big guy it's ok it's only us here  
Will: what do you know about her?

Mike: Nothing, besides her name cause I saw it when I gave the Medics her Wallet with her ID  
Will: Maybe if we can get you around her again   
Mike: not gonna happen I doubt I'll ever see her again and I'm telling ya'll Thalos just bugging out for nothing the Elder Gods are not worried about . scumbag humans.  
Caleb: He's afraid  
Will: He's def scared  
Mike: I'm going to work

Will: Michael we teasing you but I really am worried about you little bro  
Mike: I'm fine, I'm grown big Dog, I tie my own shoelaces and everything  
Caleb: If you could just see her again  
Mike: not gonna happen, it's been over a year and that was on the other side of the city, ya'll gotta stop watching Novelas with Elly's pregnant ass, I wish that girl the best wherever she is in this world, if I was her I probably would have left this country altogether after going through all of that, anyway I'm out I got a store to run see ya'll later.

River: Hey Zae can you watch Michael for a second I have to run to the store  
Alize: Yeah iight cool, but umm I gotta meet Kimiko later so please not too long ok  
River: Oh god not her  
Alize: don't do that she's my BEST friend and I really, really need her right now  
River: what do you mean, whats wrong

Alize: Nothing I'm fine go ahead  
River: Don't do that  
Alize: It's just you gonna God it up and I really just don't wanna hear that mess right now, I can't be open to that right now and I don't want to snap   
River: I'm sorry you feel you can't talk to me Zae, but if you ever feel like you need to talk and someone does not offer you sex as a solution I can just sit and listen too

Alize: You can sit and listen?  
River: yes, yes I can  
Alize: Jake doesn't want to be with me anymore  
River: wait didn't yall break up last year  
Alize: sit and listen huh  
River: no wait sorry I was just confused you don't tell me much I'm trying to catch up is all  
Alize: We broke up but he didn't understand the situation, remember Jozo, we were having sex and I was staying at one of his Condos and then Jake was like nah you def don't have to fuck for an apartment so he started paying my rent but Jozo rolled up to the house like Ima make ya nigga take a long nap he thinks he finna take my pussy so I'm like chill daddy you aint gotta do all that, so we start fucking again thiss slimey nigga sends a video of us fucking to jake I was so fucking mad but then he bought me a new car so I was like ok bet Ima just let Jake cool off for a bit I'll check him later.

River:.............  
Alize: so you know Jozo just got married and his new wife is crazier than him she aint even threaten me, he woke up with a knife to his neck and a gun at his dick and she told him he had to stay the fuck away, so thats when I moved back home and I was thinking alright well bet Jake must be ok by now I went to his office to see him and I thought he would be happy to see me but he tried to call security on me  
River: I'm sorry  
Alize: It's ok you didn't do it

River: no come here, I'm sorry I thought I could sit down and shut up girl thats a lot to un-pack what the entire hoopty hoo was that  
Alize: nigga did you really say whoopty hoo?  
River: well it was a lot  
Alize: this why I need my friend I need some fucks and shits in my life to the store and come back 

(why did I think he was not just another nigga why did I put myself in this position, was it me did I overestimate our relationship it was only a couple weeks and Its not like we were fucking, they were fucking, that's his type I guess, little and loud, I cannot keep dwelling on this I have to work I cannot let this man affect my work I cannot be here falling apart, shit they probably had a very nice convo after where she "daddy please forgive." and he fucked her brains out, must be nice I didn't even get that, was I just something to do while he was bored.)

(I can't keep falling apart like this, at work, at home just fucking crying over this man for what I haven't said anything to my bestie in days, Why? It's not her fault she never told me to try and fuck her brother now look at me out here hurting like a dummy and I didn't even get the dick, what a waste. I got to get past this I have to get past him I have to pull my big girl panties on cause this crying weeping bullshit is for the birds, why does it even hurt like this.)  
Mallory: I can't keep this up

Jake: Mallory are you here  
(fuck fuck fuck wiping the tears as fast as she can whats he doing here)  
Jake: Riri  
(just don't answer maybe he'll go away)

Jake: I keep trying to call you  
Mallory: I'm not the one you promised to talk to later  
Jake: What?  
Mallory: Why are you here  
Jake: look I'm sorry about the whole mess with Alize but that's a part of my past that will stay buried

Mallory: what does that have to do with me Jake  
Jake: so you want nothing more to do with me  
Mallory: you described me as the head of the radiology, I assumed it was you laying out   
Jake: she threatened you with a gun did you want me to say yeah thats my baby, so the unhinged woman had a reason to pull the trigger, cause I wasn't trying to bet your life she was bluffing  
Mallory: what  
Jake: she said she had a .. between her cheeks, I wasn't trying to find out if that was a lie or not

Mallory: so what did she say when  you called her  
Jake: I didn't I called a building meeting and gave her picture to all the security guards and let them know she is an immediate threat to alert the police right away if they saw her again.  
Mallory: Is this what sex with you does turns bitches into crazy stalkers  
Jake: it wasn't supposed to be like that it was just sex but she came to an event we were having and I saw her again since she was at my work when she asked me to go out again I thought ok shit, but we had nothing in common besides sex and she was fucking someone else so that didn't workout

Mallory: so is that why you created your little panty rule  
Jake: no, you actually did that  
Mallory: huh?  
Jake: that day on Jackies bed when I realized I was ready to devour you whole and I hadn't had a real conversation with you, I was putting myself into the same shit again so I decided I wanted to get to know you before I fucked you past the brink of Sanity  
Mallory: oh look its my bestie I've been avoiding cause her brother had me crying  
Jake: Fuck 

Mallory: I don't know Jake, I still got some big feelings to unpack   
Jake: Maly  
Mallory: please I'll call you I promise just give me some time  
Jake: I'm gonna kill that little girl  
Mallory: Why would you even want to risk being around her again............................. nevermind

Jackie: you know what it sounds like to me?  
Mallory: What? 

Jackie: It sounds like things moving differently than you used to and you are not used to it and so you holding on to the first sign of trouble and self-sabotaging because you feel like it's safer for you to break your own heart than to wait and you fall so deep you give him the opportunity to hurt you in a way you don't think you can recover from  
Mallory: Who asked you

Caleb: are the rumors true are you developing a new shifting ability  
Jackie:if you can call it that lol 😂 the other day I made my hair change colors  
Caleb:ooooh spicy 

Jackie: I’ve got another trick too, watch me make ya meat disappear  
Caleb: ok do I have to close my eyes or   
Mallory: Jackie you home?  
Jackie: shit get dressed 

Caleb: that’s not exactly dressed   
Jackie: this my house  
Caleb:true lol, guess I’m not ya little secret anymore  
Jackie: you were never my little secret Caleb I was yours, you didn’t want your brothers to know you was smashing the homie 

Caleb: you really believe that  
Jackie: I mean yeah, you used to ask me shit like if I’m not gonna randomly change into Jake while we was fucking and he couldn’t watch us and blah di blah blah   
Caleb: you were my first shifter I was curious sorry if I made you feel weird I just wasn’t sure what to expect but I most certainly wasn’t trying to hide you. 

Mallory: Girl I just got to talk to you cause ya brother oooohhhhh, shit my bad did I?  
Jackie: yes, yes you did  
Mallory: I’m sorry, I just wanted some advice is all and I …….. and I’m sorry  
Jackie: talk fast my coochie hungry 

Mallory: Umm hello  
Jackie: Mallory, this is Caleb, Caleb this is Mallory, let's go  
Mallory: wait what  
Jackie: You want to have this convo here in front of a man you just met  
Mallory: no I mean you right,  I guess

Caleb: No she's waiting for you to put me out so you can talk  
Mallory: sir I am not that rude  
Jackie: but I am and I'm trying to hurry through this talk so I can put you out and get back to him  
Mallory: thats crazyyyy  
Jackie: so cause you dick deprived I should be too?

Mallory: You ain't shit  
Jackie: ain't never gonna be, Caleb  
Caleb: Yeah  
Jackie: Take off ya clothes ima be right back and I'm not in the mood to wait  
Caleb: wow, just get ya dick ready huh  
Jackie: YEAH  
Caleb: yes MA'AM 

Jake: Hey River good to see you  
River: yeah, did you hear anything from the cardiologist  
Jake: I did all good things, all of it, which is why I also have some more news for you today, some good, some transitional  
River: what do you mean?

Jake: Our time is coming to an end now and little Mikey will be working strictly with his PCP and specialist as needed  
River: wait what  
Jake: Yeah, this is good news

River: How you're the top pediatrician in the Nation, and now you're leaving us, is it because of Alize please don't do this  
Jake: I would NEVER, put patients well being in jeopardy because of personal reasons, plus the building restraint on your sister is plenty enough to keep me from dealing with her, but I am a Pediatric SURGICAL specialist the reason I even stayed on as long as I did is that I pride myself on my patients and I needed to be sure he was absolutely fine before we parted ways.

River: you have a restraining order on Alize  
Jake: A building order of protection, these children mean everything to me, your sister showing up here naked and threatening nurses with guns is beyond unforgivable.  
River: She didn't  
Jake: she indeed did, but still this is not about her, he really has graduated past me now and I really am so very proud of my little potatoe

River:So he's all better  
Jake: He's got the all-clear from me  
River: I'm sorry about Alize, she really is  a troubled child, I believe she loves you but I believe she doesn't know what to do with that information what that means how she should move, or what behavior someone who is in love shows  
Jake: I'm sorry but that's none of my concern anymore, I gave your sister a chance even when I had no interest in a relationship with her because my mom taught me to see the best in everyone and she threw that back in my face so I'd very much like this to end at a building order but if need be I'll get a full order of protection on her   
River: Oh my

Jake: Feel Free to pass that message on  
River: She's just a girl  
Jake: She's a year older than me, please don't make excuses, I understand she's family so if you care warn her because I'm very serious about saving my relationship and nothing and no one is going to upset my wife. Now I hate to just run like this but I have an appointment I absolutely can't be late for  
River: be blessed Jake  
Jake: Live well River   
Jake: You really came  
Mallory: did you not want me to? cause I can still go  
Jake: Let me just Process, tonight really was a shot in the dark but I've missed you so much  
Mallory: Yeah well thank ya sister

Mallory: you got another sister?  
Jake: yes actually, we have a baby sister

Jake: You here that buddy she ain't come for me you the star of this show  
Mallory: At least you know  
Jake: So you didn't miss me a little bit  
Mallory: shut up of course I did, how could I miss your dick, you can't miss what you never had  
Jake: Not true cause I missed ALL of you, even the parts I never had

Mallory: No but wait hear me out, you tasted it, I've never even had a taste, you just been over there sucking and touching and teasing my pussy and I STILL don't know if that shrimp gang shit is just a joke or I'ma really have to hang you for making me fall in love with you and you got a little ass dick, on god I'd sacrifice you.

Alize: touchy  
River: yeah, so back off

mikey makes mumbles and pulls at his mother's collar smiling lovingly up at her  
Alize: Congratulations little man  
Mikey: NNnnnNNnNn  
River: I'm sure that means thank you, now why don't you go in my closet and go find something a little more decent to wear to his party

Alize: River nothing is wrong with the way I look, I look the fuck good  
River: for a night club not a children's party   
Alize: you dragging it I would never wear this to a club  
River: Alize I feel like you really don't have a concept of what is and what isn't innappropriate

Alize: I feel like you gon't grasp the concept of grown and sexy  
River: my point exactly this isn't a grown and sexy space Zae, it's a kids party with a bunch of church folks and you trying to come dressed like you hooking  
Alize: I might as well, at least I can afford to not have to stay here anymore and put up with ya mouth anymore  
River: you real ungrateful little you know that?  
Alize: You've mentioned it a couple times

River: I am really trying with you but I don't know if I can anymore  
Alize: another put me out threat? Cause at this point I'm ready to go  
River: is that it? You ready to go so you being nasty to me and disrespecting me in my own house haha thats cute Zae I hope you don't go out into the world and fall onto ya face again  
Alize:No you misunderstand 

River: so talk to me  
Alize: we argue, EVERYDAY  
River: Gospel truth  
Alize: and I feel like we just too much in each others space I need to get out ya face and you out mine  
River: you speak with some wisdom sister

Alize: hold on it's Kimi  
River: lord what she want  
Alize: don't do her  
River: I would NEVER  
Alize: Stop, cause she a more loyal sister than you are

River: excuse me  
Alize: nah don't play you know what I'm talking about  
River: not this again  
Alize: yes this again, this until the end of time you betrayed me, your only sister and you sold me out

River: Alize, how exactly did I sell you out?  
Alize: what you mean how? that man told you he put a order of protection on me  
River: building order, you'd have to go to court for an official order  
Alize: whatever, and then said he'd get the real thing if I showed up anywhere else and you defend me or nothing, instead you come home to tell me what the stupid nigga did and how he supposed to be in love with some new bitch like I give a fuck

River: Ok if you gonna be cussing I'm gonna put mikey down cause he's starting to try and say words  
Alize: can't even say anything for yourself, so don't talk on my bestie/my wifey/ my sis when I know she'd take the bullet you'd probably be firing.  
River: that's absolutely insane to hear, but it tracks, it's on route with the spoiled brat you've become, you showed up at that man's job and got butt naked after he rebuffed you repeatedly then threatened to shoot one of his coworkers when he showed no interest in talking to you, do you hear how unhinged you sound, downright rapey if you were a man you would say, so how don't you see it now that it's you.

Alize: It wasn't that bad  
River: it was a childrens hospital, what if a child saw you, what if your gun mis fired  
Alize: come on I wasn't really gonna shoot the bitch I just wanted her to shut up and leave  
River: talking about that where a child with a heart condition could have over heard could have meant that childs life 

Alize:Ok Okay it was a little much, yes but like oh my god this is now blowing it out the water like I missed him I did the most and as my sister, you know how much I love him  
River: the worst part is you keep accusing me of not defending me and that's actually false and as much as he denies it I still believe that's why he stopped being mikeys doctor  
Alize: Wait, he stopped seeing Mikey  
River: yeah says he doesn't need him anymore 

Alize: I'm sorry, I love him, I just wanted him back I really miss him, he was supposed to be my happy ending  
River: well it appears it's too late now, it seems he's found a happy ending he doesn't want to risk hurting and he said he's willing to do anything to protect her  
Alize: why are you saying this why are you lying I'm already hurting  
River: I'm not lying, I never said anything before because I figured hearing about the order alone would be enough to sober you up 

Alize: you knew all along he had a girlfriend  
River: yeah he told me at the appointment, he's in love and he'll do anything in his power to protect her  
Alize: NO, no, no I don't believe you, you don't have to go this route you don't have to be cruel, he just needs time  
River: I'm not lying, and you know I'm not lying 

Alize: It's not fair, I love him so much it's not fair  
Downstairs the doorbell rings.  
River: My guest are starting to come just relax for a little bit ok  
Alize: fuck you and yo holy baptist bitches I'll leave out the back in a little bit  
River: Zae, this is why I didn't want to tell you, I didn't to see you hurt like this  
Alize: leave me alone   
Kikyo: My little Miko I missed you so much  
Kimiko: Kaachan, I missed you too so much, how are you, are they good to you do they treat you nice, are you eating good  
Kikyo: I'm as good as I can be in old people's jail  
Kimi: noooooo don't say it like that, you know you got a bunch of meds and stuff they say you have to take thats why it's better this way, I don't want you here I hate that I have to be away from you I miss you so much but I don't want you to be sick 

Kikyo: I would honestly rather spend one last month sitting in the country looking over the land I called home than slowly wasting away here, because this life away from friends and family, it's not living it's prolonging death it's a big difference  
Kimi: I didn't know you were so unhappy  
Kikyo: I know you have done everything to make sure your old mother is comfortable and I thank you, after your father passed and I got sick, I don't know how but you took over and turned our lives around. 

Unable to hide the disappointment in her face and unwilling to bite her tongue the old woman continued.  
Kikyo: Who am I Kidding everyone knows exactly how you did it, you marched that Chitsu all across the city into every wealthy mans lap and I was in no position to stop you, I should be asking you if they are being good to you if they are treating you ok  
Kimi: they are, they even have Sota in a really nice boarding school, he's doing so good you should be so proud of him  
Kikyo: My son 

Kimi: he misses you too  
Kikyo: I've wronged him  
Kimi: how?  
Kikyo: I had him at such an old age, now he spends his days missing his old sick mom, whose locked away in old lady jail, with no one to look to but his O nechan to be his Mama  
Kimi: oh no that could never be me 

A blaring voice comes on over the loud speaker announcing the end of visiting hours, the unwanted intrusion causing both women to force a brave smile to hide the well of tears fighting to burst free.  
Kimi: welp guess it's that time again  
Kikyo: Gotta take my nighttime pills and go meet your papa in my dreams  
Kimi: you still dream of him That kind of beautiful  
Kikyo: He is my only love I will dream of him till I meet him again 

Kimi: I love you mom, I'll see you again real soon  
Kikyo: I love you too my honey please take care of yourself  
Kimi: I promise mommy  
Kikyo: give Sota my love  
Kimi: you know I will 

Kimi: don't be getting frisky with the male nurse's lady behave yourself  
Kikyo: you can't tell me that  
Kimi: I can and I did  
Kikyo: You can't tell me anything young lady I'm grown 

Alize: You know you can fit under here right  
Kimi: the restaurant is right there I don't know why you took that out of the car  
Alize: Cause I don't cassually wet my hair  
Kimi: You should try it one day it feels great  
Alize: it's fine you wouldn't understand 

Alize: this place is really nice, I miss going to nice spots I miss nice niggas  
Kimi: I mean I told you I share  
Alize: yeah but they both look at you like you're the only woman in the world  
Kimi: Annnddd..... they like you too  
Alize: Cap 

Kimi: no I'm dead especially Demetri, he's really into Miss Chocolate Thunder  
Alize: lol What  
Kimi: Remember you made them watch cat in the hat lol  
Alize: Oh my god yes, and he remembers that 

Kimi: I'm telling you they really into you  
Alize: ok so, I been thinking about the offer and I thinkk I really am ready to get the fuck out of River's house, I feel lik shes getting worse by the second and the way how I love my sister and don't want to lose her because of an argument I need to just go my own, but I need to know whats the catch  
Kimi: Catch  
Alize: I'm not stupid Kimi lay it out don't be fucked up 

Kimi: no I know, I'm trying to figure out the best way to tell you  
Alize: damn that bad  
Kimi: kinda  
Alize: shit, ok well lay it on me, lets see exactly how bad. 

Kimi: so how much you remember I told you bout the guys?  
Alize: They Demons, but like they kinda important you said something like Andrews family not just money but like fake real Royalty   
Kimi: Demetri  
Alize: oh yeah see that make more sense 

Kimi: So the thing is they are like real important unlike the other Clans only royal line and those they knight can be on earth with them except for certain occasions when certain demons and other hellish creatures that aren't from earth realm are able to roam the Earth and the boys are tasked with being the ones who throw the big parties when big shots cross overs, they the ones the big name demons come to see for a good time on earth,........... for a price of course 

Alize: of course  
Kimi: so here the catch  
Alize: oh fuck  
Kimi: This big Demon Council event is coming up with the heads and they need............entertainment, so the boys were hoping that you and I could you know 

Alize: They want us to fuck a couple of big shot demons   
Kimi: yeah  
Alize: I'm sorry, I'm a full blood human aren't you?  
Kimi: yeah  
Alize: don't the none earth ones not fuck with us at all, you sure it's not just a human sacrifice 

Kimi: I know how it sounds, we're the guilty pleasure they get to indulge in, it's not my first rodeo, it's why they keep my family set up pretty nice for me, but this time it's a bit more so they figured I could use some help, they give you this drug, you won't even be there you'll be a million  miles away, please don't think me the worst type of bitch for asking you to do this while ya sister is being a funky bitch. 

Alize: You my only real sister lets not talk about that judgemental ass bitch anymore fuck her, so what kinda deal with the devil shit can I ask for if I do this  
Kimi: oh my god, really you'll help me?  
Alize: I've given away pussy for less than deals with the devil, ooh you think I can get my own Island  
Kimi: Really bitch  
Alize: maybe they can steal Jakes heart for me 

Caleb: we having any company today  
Jackie: no my little puppy you have no worries  
Caleb: I said it before I'm not worried about anything, you're the one with the reputation to protect don't want it to get out you've got a werewolf under your bed  
Jackie: I don't think who I'm fucking is of anyone's concern

Caleb: But for some reason, do you think who I am is?  
Jackie: No I Just.......  
Caleb: I don't give a damn who knows, I'm only docile about it because I know how you are........or I'd have marked you already  
Jackie: Caleb  
Caleb: I didn't stutter, every time you fuck around and let me bust inside you I pray this the nut that traps ya ass, so I find it really funny you here thinking I'm hiding you

Jackie: I should make you wear a condom after what you just said  
Caleb: oh word, speak now or forever hold your peace  
Jackie:................  
Caleb: thought so

Jackie: MMM Fuck you Caleb  
Caleb: For as long as you want to  
Jacki: Babyyy  
Caleb: yes love  
Jackie: I can't come anymore  
Caleb: sure you can watch

Jackie: CALEB\!\!\!  
Caleb: see, never doubt yourself  
Jackie: no baby I mean I gotta go  
Caleb: why, this is your house?

Jackie: I gotta go to work to pay for this house you insatiable beast  
Cable: oh, yeah right his laugh was low but he made no real movements to release her just yet I mean it's only been a couple of hours  
Jackie: .. of them to be exact wolf boy, now come on cause I'm as stuck on you as you are on me if not more so let's come together one more time then I have to go try and be a functioning adult.

Caleb: yes Ma'am  
Jackie: I'm very fond of you wolfy  
Caleb: I know Jackie, I love you too  
Jackie: What\!\!

Kimi: Is this everyone?  
Andrew: yeah it seems some things happening back home we had some cancelations  
Kimi: oh woah, its not nearly as many as you said  
Andrew: are you disappointed?  
Kimi: Don't be silly this is great and the hair ripper guy isn't here, I was really afraid about him coming across Alize  
Andrew: Yeah that might have been a problem

Kimi: So umm where are the other girls?  
Andrew: the sacrifices are here as well, I know you don't like the splatter show so If you see one go in a room don't go in that room because you don't know who is in the room with them and you don't know if they are hungry  
Kimi: Jesus  
Andrew: He's not here beloved

Alize: why the fuck are they all dressed like this, why the fuck doe that look like he's dressed like Sesshomaru, Is that Sukuna  
Demetri: they thought it would be more appealing to you  
Alize: What  
Demetri: these guys don't leave the other Realm so all they know about you lot is what they get from Tv and Anime says these are the demons that get pussy on earth soooooo  
Alize: would I die if I laughed?

. — . .:. .  
Demetri: Enjoy yourself today is about enjoyment my love  
Chaos: Are you sure about these two my lord?  
Demetri: Don't question me  
Chaos: Yes sir  
Demetri: listen meetings are all done for the day, we've avoided war again unfortunately lets go , let go 

Ann: Hi My name is Anna  
Purson: and you believe in making light of the situation your bravery will be rewarded and you will not be consumed at the end you will scream for your unborn child as it is removed from you when we begin the feast, and as promised the rest of your family will not be harmed and your traitorous husband will be slaughtered in a manner more horrific than yours  
Ann: ...........Oh  
Purson: I'd like to fuck you now

Demetri: Alize is not to be eaten Amdusias, she is my willing guest  
Amdu: AAAHHHH resTRAINT WHAT FUN  
Alize: Music,?  
Demetri: you are being gifted a performance.  
Loud banging at the door did not halt either demon's strokes.  
Agares: Make room for more we want to fuck the moor too  
Demetri: come in she's ready

Demetri: are you ready little one  
Agares: she can't answer you, friend, sshhhhhhhhhee's got dicckk and oooo balls in the throat, my lord Satan  
Demetri: well be prepared  
This wasn't that bad, was all Alexis kept saying in her head, she's been in worse spots, but how very tired she was of being in these spots.

Astaroth: I tire of this hole, I'm off to find another  
Incubo raises a hand and gives a thumbs up from under his meal, but as soon as Astaroth arises the young Alien girl jumps up and materializes her uniform, both men standing behind her, oh my what new entertainment is this, they do so love a fighter breaking a fighter was a sweeter victory.

Astaroth: Incubo are you finished with this why is it dressed  
Alien : My deal was I only had to let one of you monsters fuck me beofre my death and you would award my family for my loyalty  
Incubo: please you sound as if you did not enjoy yourself  
Alien: I spit on you  
Incubo: you did in my mouth I enjoyed it very much  
Astaroth: So fiesty lets eat her  
Incubo: lets

Focalor: Purson, I do believe that ones not for eating  
Purson: Oh fuck the little prince, she looks ever so sweet  
Focalor: So help me understand, you are so weak, simple and foolish you would start a war on OUR REALM not even on earth, you would bring the trouble home because you............ I don't know make it make sense if you will?  
Purson: She wants me to, tell him  
Kimi: Fuck off, you gonna fuck this pussy and get this Holy nut or you finna Risk a war

Appearing instantly with a deep-chested laugh  
Astaroth: are they all like this?  
Focalor: How Goes it? This fool here is debating Civil war or not, I lay my stance now, I would Ride with my full army behind Mammon before I follow someone so foolish as you throwing it all away for some tiny girl.  
Purson: Isn't he doing the same  
Focalor: No he is simply punishing an insolent who would challenge his command

Astaroth: this sounds like a lot less fun and a lot more politics and it appears a young one just took a breath of relief let me pay her a visit  
Focalor: Enjoy, as soon as he's finished I need my taste of this worthy flesh  
AsTa: Enjoy

Alize: WAIT WHAT THE FUCK\!\!\!  
AsTa: it must be my lucky day, the other forbidden flesh  
Alize: NIGGA DID YOU JUST MATERIALIZE IN MY PUSSY  
AsTa: would you have preferred your ass  
Alize: a smart-ass demon just my luck ok well it's only you so bet, you want me to ride this dick Daddy?AsTa: well aren't you full of surprises, Mammon really knows how to pickem  
Alize: who?  
AsTa: I think here, you call him Demetri  
Alize: Oh, can we not talk bout none a that shit, cauuusssee ya dick actually feel real fucking good after what I just dealt with so umm please please please please lemme come at least one time tonight, or I gotta sell my soul or some shit?  
AsTa: bold of you to assume it's not already ours 

Astaroth could not deny in all his centuries this was his most entertaining after-council gathering, on sure why he decided to acquiesce her request, feeling her move up and down his shaft he wrapped one arm tightly around her waist the way her moans became erratic and his member slick with her juiceses he could tell her climax was near licking her neck just beneath her ear he whispered.  
AsTa: But your body, you could vow to me and only me to have and do with whatever I please as long as it brought you pleasure, and I'll let you cum  
His voice was so deep and smooth it was like the words came from him but they were getting caught in her throat.  
Alize: You won't hurt or kill me?  
AsTa: On My Tittle as a Ruling King of Hell  
Alize: YES TAKE ME  
With those words he took hold with both hands and held her in place as he ground his hips up into her drawing out her orgasm from below, this was only just the start of the fun.

Malphas: I don't know WHy I come to these things, the sacrifices are good yes but they never have enough holes and I hate to share............................................. At least I look the coolest   
Ohhhh so no kicking and screaming  
Jackie: huh?  
Mallory: You been missing in action, so I figured I would have to come here and drag you back to work kicking and screaming, but here you are dressed and ready to ruin my fun I see  
Jackie: lol Sorry you want me to go get naked  
Mallory: don't threaten me with a good time

A low growl crept around the room but no one was there.   
Mallory: is he  
Jackie: Still here? kinda jealous? EAVES DROPPING? Yes to all the above  
Caleb appeared on the window naked as she left him only for a second before he morphed into a wolf Large enough to fill her Floor-to-ceiling window.   
Mallory: Did we, is he mad  
Jackie: no he's giving us some privacy

Mallory: Ok well since Daddies gone gimme a hug cause I missed my bestie  
Jackie: MMMm I missed you too but I know you been out getting ya clock cleaned too  
Mallory: MEEEEAAAAANNNNNNN, naahhhh nnaaaaaahhhh thats ya brother I aint trying to gross you out but bitch lemme just say a bitch is caught up  
Jackie: Shit I might have to say the same cause this ain't no puppy he a big Dawg

Mallory: OOh Bitch I seen he lucky yo house big as fuck he just be transforming and shit in the house  
Jackie: In the house, in the backyard  
Mallory: In ya pussy?  
Jackie: Bitch\!\!\!\!  
Mallory: WHHAAATTTT, I wanna know the readers wanna know, you ever?  
She couldn't hold in the big belly laugh burst out before she could catch herself.

Jackie: No bitch I do not let him fuck me in wolf form, that is not the kinda Doggystyle I'm into  
Mallory: I mean I'm not judging   
Jackie: Cause ain't shit to judge  
Mallory: I mean if you did  
Jackie: You's a  lying hoe you'd call me every name you could think of you'd talk so much shit we could rent ya mouth out as a porter potty, you act like I don't know you

. — . .:. .  
Mallory: You think I would just Dog you? You think I'm that man?  
Both women started to laugh.  
Jackie: Seeeee you so stupid  
Mallory: No but like I'm real, real happy for us, look at us, healthy relationships, good sex, skin glowing I love it

Jacie: see I don't wanna hear no shit like skin glowing cause he made a prego remark  
Mallory: oop that nigga clock ticking you know you can't run too far when the niggas clock starts ticking, so you better go hide before he trap yo ass  
Jackie: Ain't no babies round here  
Mallory: if he didn't already  
Jackie: thats not funny lets go we got work to go to

Purson: he would caution me against war then he would claim one of Mammon's brides as his own who is really the fool and selfish one  
AsTa: you speak words freely without backing or substance because you have a mouth  
Purson: so then what did you do if not start your own war?  
AsTa: she was not a Bride Of Mammons only the tiny red one, but now she is mine given herself freely in her Realm 

Purson: and what do you want with this human Great Duke of Hell and part of the evil trinity, Astaroth what could you possibly gain  
AsTa: Entertainment   
Purson: I am expected to believe  
AsTa: Whatever you like but that's the answer you'll get from me now I must head back I'd like to................. change.

AsTa: Much better, I do prefer something with a bit of color, now to Contact Mammon and Drekavac so they know of my plans to take her away from their home into a dwelling I can freely apparate in and out of. 

AsTa: This willing little creature, how sorrowful is your life for you to throw it into my arms, did you not grasp the gravity of the situation, surely a little thing like Hormones didn't doom you to the life of demon sex slave so easily, so many things I must know, the fun I will have picking your little brain. 

Astaroth looked over his Realm this would be the longest he would spend away but he had the freedom to walk the earth now with this contract and he fully planned on making use of it, he had many research projects to run but first, he'd meet his new pet and introduce her to her new life, it would be a dream come true until the nightmare began but she needn't worry about that now, humans had so little time who even knew if she'd be alive by the time he was able to put his plan into action. 

AsTa: I'll return   
Will: I need you to be Onboard with me tonight Mike, all the other high councils have had meetings and they are bringing up loads of old shit so I'm already assuming they are going to bring you up.  
Michael: This never gets old  
Will: You think I'm not completely sick of this.  
Michael: are the girls coming?

. — . ..:.. .  
Will: Dex is coming, Elly said she's not interested   
Mike: she, is it the baby?  
Will: I've had a lot of running around to do on your behalf, this pregnancy has been a bit more lonely for her than she imagined and  
Mike: So say fuck those assholes and go be with your pregnant Mate

Will: Yes it makes sense that in your head it would be that easy  
Mike: I damn sure wasn't gonna have them keeping me away from my Mate this much  
Will: A mate you don't have  
Mike: Ok show off for the context of the conversation I was speaking of the things I would do if I were blessed with a mate instead of leaving her to lonesome.

. — . .:. .  
Will: Fuck you  
Mike: I Couldn't imagine a little fish in a house filled with dogs carrying a hybrid baby unsure what to expect and Alone.  
Every Muscle in Will's body rolled under his skin he had to fight the urge to burst forth and Rip his brother's head off, here was the reason for his absence lecturing him on being away, the very thought of her in that little pool unable to transform while pregnant, knowing she'd rather be back in the ocean with her family now of all times, biting his tongue till the blood pooled his mouth, the bitterness matching his Rage, Very Low and very slow he responded.  
Will: Back off NOW, I have had more than my fill of you  
Caleb: I would take that warning Michael, let this go, Will my friend

Will: Stranger, where have you been  
Caleb: With Jackie  
Will: Oh my it's been forever how are they, how's Jake doing ?  
Caleb: I don't know he wasn't around  
Will: WHATT\!\!\!\!\!\!\!  
Caleb: Longest story short, they've performed a split no more shifting they are living as .

Will: Wait and you said  
Caleb: No wait, yes, I was with her, I think I found my mate  
Will: Oh shit really  
Caleb: it's like A constant fight with the beast not to mark her  
Will: Don't I know it my friend, like you're denying him Air.

Caleb: But I want to ask her to be mine, I Know my little Viper she bites, and I won't Mark her without giving her the choice  
Mike: what if she says no?  
Caleb: it's not a full moon whats wrong with the pup?

Will: He saw the girl again  
Mike: I'm right here  
Caleb: holy shit did they talk?  
Mike: Like I'm invisible  
Will: Eh, sort of, kind of  
Mike: I'll just see myself out

Caleb: ok so what happened?  
Will: welp, she walked right into his store, and walked right up to him for help  
Caleb: No fucking way  
Will: yup, very Alive, still living here and Super Christian

Caleb: Oh Man  
Will: yeah he said she mentioned Jesus more times than he could remember during the brief exchange.  
Caleb: I Gotta tell ya, man Zeus was a speedy motherfucker with that rebrand, he saw them humans slipping and he said Right boom new year new me and they ate that shit up.  
Will: Right, but it's like slavery to some

Caleb: He created them but let some of them tell it they created him  
Will: I mean they were created in his  what does that say about him  
Caleb: So about the young lady  
Will: So she was looking for root work herbs so I got curious and since he's not here anymore I can lay on you some recent information we just found out.

Caleb: You're being dramatic, why did you get up  
Will: Because he also found out she had a baby after, My little brothers super Cristian Damsel in distress, whose blood called to him so wildly that he ripped apart . grown men and couldn't control his beast properly for a month after,.............................  
Caleb: YESSSSSSSSSSS

Will: Is a Witch  
Caleb: Get the fuck out of here  
Will: Nope, Thalos and I did some real digging looks like Her mother's coven was Destroyed when she was an infant she was raised in a Baptist orphanage and raised her girls to be devout christians, they know nothing, but her body was under so much stress it must have tapped into her inner charge and screamed out for help  
Caleb: BUT DON'T THIS MEAN HE ACTUALLY COULD FUCK, I MEAN, WORDS I KNOW WORDS  
Will: felt

Andrew: This is very Nice  
Demetri: I agree  
Kimi: Daddy Who are we visiting?  
Drew: No one, we're dropping off   
Kimi: Dropping off?

Demetri: Alize, this is your new home  
Alize: why you fucking with me Mammon  
Demetri: Oh my, you let her play with Demons one day she tries to summon your true form, be careful with true names  
Alize giggled at her little pull, bet no one expected that.  
Alize: OOps my bad, but for real what you mean?

Demetri: I made the rules very clear to you and you have gone ahead and given your body to Astaroth, to do with as he pleases  
Alize: Oh that's his name, girl that's Sephiroth I was telling you was making me go dumb with the dick, he even sucked the cum out my pussy when he was done.   
Kimi: So what does that mean  
Demetri: that she lives here now, so he may freely have access to the pleasures she has promised him. 

Kimi: At least you got your own place again   
Alize: mmmm and my own demon  
Kimi: I'm gonna miss you girlie  
Alize: I mean you can come and visit I'm not too far, you can even spend the night  
Demetri: NO

Alize: wait why not, she's not allowed to have sleepovers  
Demetri: Not in a house that has an open invitation with a Demon who is not her master, who is coming to indulge, we aren't always at our clearest mind when it comes to indulgence.  
Kimi: no but that guy is ask ya friends cause that Pussnon guy wanted to eat me, and he's the one who talked him down.  
Demetri: What did you say?

Kimi: Pussnon  
Demetri: Purson  
Kimi: Yeah him, he was trying to come up with why it should just be ok to eat me and I heard the one that was dressed like sesshomaru say Astaroth and he said that if he did that dumb shit he would stand behnd you with his entire army.  
Demetri: It's always good to hear that a good friend remains a good friend even when you aren't within ear shot

AsTa: Drekavac  
Drew: The mortals call me Andrew or Drew for short, you might want to think of something they can use outside of you full title my friend   
AsTa: Asher or AsTa for short  
Drew: how imaginative

Demetri: I don't know what you're up to my friend but be careful, it's a lot more to that one than meets the eye  
AsTa: I can only hope, I've had fantasies I've plucked a treasure now it's time to open up  
Demetri: What did she ask for in return of this deal  
AsTa: I won't hurt her and I don't kill her  
Demetri: You must be insane you know how fragile these creatures, words could hurt her.  
Demetri laughed his way out of the house it seemed these events would be entertaining for him as well.

Astatroth walked into the Living room to find Alize sleeping soundly on the couch, no doubt Demetri's doing, he briefly contemplated leaving her that way, then she softly snored and moved, making her dress slip above her thigh and bestowing him a sight that made his cock twitch.  
AsTa: Wake from slumber

Alize popped up head kind of fuzzy she wasn't even sure when or how she fell asleep, and who the fuck was this Blade looking motherfucker, where were Demetri and Kimi, catching the slight confusion in her face Astaroth smiled and asked ever so gently.  
AsTa: is my new skin displeasing to you  
Alize:Astaroth?

AsTa: Yes  
Alize: Wait, new skin, like black fack, cause ain't you white  
AsTa: I'm a Black and green dragon so I guess I'm mixed  
Alize: I fucked a dragon?  
AsTa: You think I'm the biggest bad that fucked you at the party that's funny.

Alize: ok so like we chopping it up, keep it real with me, why are you giving me all this stuff like I keep trying to think of the loophole where you sacrifice me or I get eaten or something but like Kimi told me ya'll contracts pretty binding and I get to fuck you and come on, you was iight before but you fine af now and you can't kill or hurt me, so what's in it for you? I mean what do you get, you even gave me my own place.

AsTa: I enjoy pleasures of the flesh and as a duke with command over many legions I have little to no time to set aside to indulge you provided an opportunity to escape and enjoy.  
Alize: Oh, yeah I guess win, win  
AsTa: And now I'm hungry  
He stood so fast and spoke so fast the next thing she knew she was naked.

Alize: should I get used to you never taking things slow  
AsTa: You with the short life span would like me to waste your time?  
Alize: I mean you just be poofing into a bitches pussy all off guard and shit

AsTa: I just knew You'd be fun, ok, taking things slow, dinner before the show.  
Alize: Oh my god, don't do the thing with ya two tongues again cause I'ma actually die this time

AsTa: you're not allowed to die anymore remember  
Alize: Shit, ok, OK, OK fuck you got it lemme suck ya dick.

AsTa: What was all that about taking our time,

But Alize wasn't trying to hear shit he had to say demon, human, mermaid she ain't give a fuck this nigga been having her busting all over the place and now he was spoiling her she was running up a bill she wasn't sure she could pay as her momma would say, so she put everything into sucking the dick in front of her.

Spit slurping while clenching her throat on the head and she felt the pay off coming he tried to back up, so she held him steady working her tongue with purpose, moaning against him, it wasn't long till she got her payoff.  
AsTa: Fuck, and they call me the devil.

AsTa: You are the gift that keeps on giving  
Alize: And you........ taste like cotton candy, why  
AsTa: I know it's your favorite flavor  
Alize: My Nigga  
AsTa: I guess by Earth terms I'd be that............very toxic relationship though, if you were to be with someone else I'd have to end our contract and kill you both

Alize: But our deal  
AsTa: says Within the contract, but a breach of trust would definitely call for an end of the contract and I do believe the only way to heal my broken pride would be to slaughter you both  
Alize: Oh come on no, no. 

AsTa: Problem?  
Alize: I've never been faithful my entire life, I'ma cheating ass hoe, you met me trying to make a deal to get my Ex back who I cheated on, now I'ma die, this some bullshit  
AsTa: oh come here I have faith in you  
Alize: really?  
AsTa: but here's the deal, if you try to fight it and they keep pushing it, I kill them you live, deal?  
Alize: DEAL\!\!\!\!  
ackie: Oh God the fuck did I eat, feel like I'm on a ship during a storm after gas station sushi, this can't be life has the cafeteria food gotten that bad?

speeding around the corner knocking everything in her path over Jackie just barely made it to the toilet when up it came everything she ate and even thought of eating.

What was this divine punishment, did she anger some god, why was her body allergic to food this week, everything she would crave and become moody about would sit fine for a bit and then...........

Jackie: No  
Cause ain't no fucking way, cycles had been a bit harder to track since the split but they were tracked and no sex happened during times of spawning so what the fuck is this.  
Caleb: JACKIE?????  
Jackie: ofcourse, you're here COMING\!\!\!\!\!\!

Jackie: Hey baby I was just  
Caleb: REALLY?  
Jackie: huh?  
Caleb:this is not at all how I planned to do this, I was gonna go slow take my time, you mean so much to me  
Jackie: you aren't making any sense

Caleb: Be mine  
Jackie: Caleb  
Caleb: say you'll be my Mate, take my mark and be mine forever  
Jackie: Wait are you being for real  
Caleb: very real.

Jackie: You sure   
Caleb: Woman  
Jackie: you keep kissing and sucking on me nigga I can't think  
Caleb: Neither can I, Every part of me needs you to be marked to be properly claimed and then protected until the baby is born

Jackie: ah shit I really am pregnant huh?  
Caleb: yes  
Jackie: So you wanna mate me cause I'm prego?  
Caleb: no I've wanted to mark you for awhile but I wanted you to choose me too and now I know you're having my pup I NEED to know if you choose me too

Jackie: I Do, I choose you, now let me breathe, I gotta come to terms with being pregnant  
Caleb: Ok, I'm sorry, I Love you  
Jackie: I'm fond of you too  
Caleb: ok Peebody

Elly: Did you know Wolf pups are born blind, deaf, and weigh about a minimum .. pounds  
Will: MMhhhmmm  
Elly: I'll kill you if this baby is .. pounds  
Will: thats not nice  
Elly: Neither is putting a Christmas turkey in me

Elly: Unlike Wolf pregnancies that only last about . months Werewolf pregnancies  can last up to .. months......................What kind of flowers should we have?  
Will: HMM?  
Elly: At your funeral  
Will: What did I do?  
Elly: hide these fun facts during courtship

. — . ..:.. .  
Will: would you love me less?  
Elly: I'd try to  
WIll: Better than me, I could never, from the moment I saw you every part of me knew I would never breathe another meaningful breath without you in my life

Elly: You say all the things but thats all they are pretty words  
Will: not they are my truth, and I'm going to do a better job at showing you, I'm sorry I let my little brother's bullshit have you feeling like you're less than my everything.  
Elly: ...........Okay

Will: I said I'll fix and I will  
Elly: sure thing  
Will: what are you reading now  
Elly: porn  
Will: think of the baby  
Elly:I'd rather think of how we made the baby

. — . ..:.. .  
Will: You'd rather use your imagination?  
Elly;I mean  
Will:\`when, I'm right here....  
Elly: What you got to offer big guy  
Will: Come here my little mermaid

Mike: what are you doing in here Dex?  
Dex: I'm in heat and I need someone to handle it  
Mike: I'm sorry wrong room your husbands is upstairs  
Dex: yeah fucking his real mate, I know you hear them too

— . ..:. .  
MIke: Woah, come on chill, you married to my big brother  
Dex: WHo doesn't want me, I was a pack marriage they thought his big ass was never gonna mark anyone and what the fuck does he do one month  after we get married, meet his true mate, so where does that leave me?

Mike: I know and I'm sorry but, I can't fuck my brothers wife.  
Dex: I mean you can, you got a dick and it works, you just won't   
Mike: I'm in enough shit right now  
Dex: Oh yeah what with your witch and you maybe having a baby and

Mike: What, I never fucked any witch   
Dex: The witch bitch you saved  
Mike:...............What are you saying?  
Dex: The girl you saved you answered her call and you said she had a baby and Witches they don't need the down and dirty like me and you to make it, they take a piece of there mate's soul and grow new life that's how they know your soul mates get it.

Dex was laughing but Mike didn't find shit funny he was fighting the urge to fling her across the room, the only reason she would know this was Will and Thalos, so how fucking long had they known and said nothing to him.  
Dex: Oh no you look mad, damn maybe I shouldn't have ate that whole eddie.  
Mike:Up  
Dex: yes sir  
Kikyo: My Kimiko, I didn't expect to see you again so soon  
Kimi: I have a lot of news  
Kikyo: am I going to be a grandmother   
Kimi: ewwwww noooooooo

Kimi: I got some money and   
Kikyo: Oh my Kimi, you shouldn't have  
Kimi: yes I did, now listen, that's not the only surprise I have another one coming too you just have to wait a second while I get everything ready. 

Kikyo: I worry my daughter I am old I'm afraid in trying to care for me you are becoming reckless and creating a debt you can't hope to repay.  
Kimi: don't worry Mommy, I paid for this upfront, I just........... I know that if Dad was still alive you'd be ok  
Kikyo: don't do that love, I miss him too he was my true love and that's all I want for you, to find your true love and live happily ever after, not selling yourself to take care of your old mother. 

Kimi: Ok little man mommy is coming and she has no idea I bought this house for you guys so let’s clean up a bit and get things together.  
Sota: Why?  
Kimi: what do you mean why? So your mom can have a nice surprise after everything she’s been through she deserves that much at least  
Sota: says who 

Kimi: Sota get up off that couch and get cleaned up right now, I don’t know what kind of spoiled behavior they teach at that little school you go to but   
Sota: you mean the prison you shipped me off to as soon as papi died?  
Kimi: WHAT\!?\!? 

Sota: you shipped me off to live it up as some demon whore meanwhile I get reminded on a daily basis that EVERYONE KNOWS what my sister does to keep me there so she can be free.  
Kimi: Sota, I didn’t, who  
Sota: Aunt Milagros said that’s why she’s forced to keep me during break and that it wasn’t fair she had to work two jobs to afford her sons being able to go to beach wood and so Ofcourse, John and Darren told everyone on campus 

Kimi: you never have to go back, after papi died we had no money I needed to make sure we were all ok  
Sota: Oh…………. Are you okay?  
Kimi: I think now I will be, I’m not stupid I been saving a lot these past two years and now we can kind of live together again I’ll still be in and out but I’ll mostly be here  
Sota: so I really don’t have to go back? 

Kimi: no now let’s get ready for mommy  
Sota: we can really live together again?  
Kimi: yuppp  
Sota: I can’t believe it, I was just planning to run away next spring break 

Kimi: well shit guess I got good timing  
Kiki:No cursing in front of your little brother  
Kimi: mommy you were supposed to wait  
Sota: SURPRISE\!\!\!\!\!\!\!  
Kikyo: I am very, very 

Sota: Kimi says we can be a family again isn’t that amazing   
Kikyo: we never stopped being a family, my love just in different homes, but I am very happy. We will be back together again. 

Kimi: I have to run but I’ll be back  
Kikyo: do you want me to cook something special?  
Kimi: anything that make your heart smile mommy, Sota be good till I get back ok.  
Sota: ok, be careful I love you   
Kimi: love you guys too 

Mallory: So like I’m telling her I wasn’t the last one in the lab so I can’t tell her who didn’t lock up but when I left and this Broke Busted Heavy Neck Loose Tooth Having Hot Wing Eating Albino Cricket had the fucking nerve to report me for having an attitude   
Jake: Mallory\!\!\! 

Mallory: No fuck that hoe, and she better not need my help with shit she done fucked around time to find out.  
Jake: you can’t do that  
Mallory; why not  
Jake: cause the patient didn’t do anything to you and her incompetence could harm them 

Mallory: sounds like that bitch need to get fired before she hurt somebody then.  
Jake: not feeling very diplomatic today are we  
Mallory: nah burn it all to the ground, burn the whole hospital down I’m tired of the whole lot of them acting like I should kiss they ass cause their Clansesters helped build the hospital. 

Jake: come here miss cranky pants  
Mallory: you better NOTTT JAKEEEE 

Jake: come on you need to cool down  
Mallory:I swear I’m finna beat you ass if you AAAAGGGHHHH JAAAKKEEEE 

Mallory: Really Nigga?  
Jake: Love you  
Mallory: suck my dick  
Jake: Grow one  
Mallory: got any tips? 

AsTa: oh my cooking?  
Alize; I figured we needed to come for food  
AsTa: I’m a demon, I don’t eat, but I’d love to watch you partake 

Alize: now boy you know that’s a DAMN lie.  
breaking away his gaze from her very round and loudly inviting ass to look her ever so confused.  
AsTa: excuse me?  
Alize: Now you know you can EAT\!\!\!\!\!\! 

with a small smile an idea formed.  
AsTa: let’s go on vacation   
Alize: wait, huh?  
AsTa: I have a bit of free time coming up and I’d like you to take you away so let’s go 

Alize: where do you wanna go?  
AsTa; let’s go to Japan I’ve got so sleeping pals who could show us a good time, you really love that sailor moon and hello kitty right?  
Alize:no I love Sailor Mercury and Kuromi  
AsTa: close enough 

Alize: You are too perfect, you’re like a dream come true  
AsTa: Whose dream?  
Alize: huh?  
AsTa: A dream for a resident in Arkham is a nightmare for the rest of Gotham .  
Alize: baby why you so crazy   
Lord I come to you in my hour of need ever faithful ever trusting but lost oh lord, I thought after the doctors gave him the ok he would be ok but not this ok, he jumps out of the crib he’s so fast I can barely keep up I’m thankful for his healing lord Jesus but I don’t know what to do with myself. 

River: Cat????  
Cat: in the back  
River: you gonna still watch him?  
Cat: yeah  
River: cause you gotta really be on him 

Cat: put my baby down and get the fuck out we good over here, we good  
River: from one cussing Auntie to another huh Mikie  
Cat: I can still hear you, you going to the store or not cause why you still here. 

I came all the out here because I lost the paper he gave me to order online and they really do have everything I need what are the odds I walk into that man again, I’m not hoping to see that man again, I don’t care if I . 

he thoughts were cut short because as she tried to force feed herself those lies the object of her strange attraction appeared, “don’t stop him, don’t stop him don’t stop him.”  
River: Excuse me ☝️ 

Mike: Oh hi, good to see you again Mrs…….  
River:River just Ms. Haven’t met mister right just yet  
Mike: sorry, didn’t mean to offend, I incorrectly put context clues from our last conversation together and made an assumption that made me an ass 

River: no fair assumption to make I would have hoped I would be married before my first child but life can be scary sometimes and when scary things happen you just gotta pray your way through it  
Mike: That is a very interesting....... you have a fascinating view of the world for someone whose been through so much.  
Michael caught himself too late he tried to trail away hoping she didn't catch on to what he just said or she was too busy mentally prepping her next bible verse, but the fates were not on his side, figures, when were they ever. 

River: Why did you say that?  
Mike: Well,I  
River: It was you, I'm not crazy, it was you the night that I was attacked, you saved me.  
Mike: I'm sorry  
River: Sorry, Why would you be sorry they could have killed me you stopped them 

Mike: I Didn't stop them before they hurt you  
River: Oh You silly boy, a hurt I have recovered from, thanks to you, I've wanted to thank you for so long but you kind of just disappeared I was starting to think I made you up   
She laughed sheepishly not knowing what to say but not knowing how to shut up.  
Mike: No Ma'am very real flesh and blood 

River: Well Thank you, I don't know how I could ever repay you  
Mike: I didn't do it for a reward, I did because I felt your pain  
River: huh?  
Mike: Nevermind, what happened was an atrocity and it makes me so very happy to see you looking so well and healthy after all you've been through, don't be a stranger, I thoroughly enjoy seeing you. 

Hours had passed the day went by River couldn't think of anything else, she almost left little Mikey at Cat's she drove back in such a daze, she cooked in a trance, cleaned in a trance and for the first time in weeks Alize didn't even cross her mind, What little sister, she just kept, hearing his voice over and over again in her head and seeing his smile, he was real and she had found him, what does that even mean, she's never engaged in any type of courtship, and whose to say he would even look at  her in that way, look at the way the others treated her after what happened and they didn't even see, he was there. 

But he didn't sound like them, he sounded worried, upset even he didn't do more, the man who saved her life.  
River: What Is wrong with me and why am I feeling like this, am I going crazy, over a man, like a teenager in heat, I'm too old for this, I didn't do it then I won't do it now, it's ridiculous no, NO  
Didn't stop the daydreaming and the fantasies. 

dream Mike: You're so beautiful I want to kiss you with my mouth  
River: We can't it wouldn't be appropriate   
dream Mike: Who cares god made you for me and I for you  
River: You think so? 

dream Mike: I know so, now let me make love to you and marry you and  
River: This is too much I really am going crazy  
dream Mike: let me make you crazy baby 

River: Ok 

River: Michael, oh god ok, mmm  
Exploring new territory but doing what feels right just letting her fingers roam and feel her innermost folds stopping to enjoy anything that gave off a delightful sensation.  
River: Michael  
Whispering his name into the air innocently but filled with so much desire, the message was sent. 

River: Ok that was a thing that I just di, I just did that thing oh good lord I've really lost my mind what in heaven's name is wrong with me, it felt so good,  of course it felt good, sin usually does, that's why backsliding is so easy.........................................................................should I call Pastor Kent about this? Who do you seek council about things like this? 

River: I need to talk to someone, I kind of, umm........I think I want to do it again, slippery slope River I'm sure this is how Alize started out......................................don't lie we all know how that poor child started out bless her soul, she calls me a victim but still hasn't come to terms how she was a victim for so long, the illusion of free will is not free will, I hope she's ok, wherever she is. 

River: What.....What's wrong with my eyes, oh lord I've got the mark of the beast Everyone is gonna know what I was doing, I'm not going anywhere. I think if I drank right now I would need a drink 

AsTa: I need a favor of you  
Alize: Whats up what you need?  
AsTa: Give me a child  
Alize: AWHAT\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!  
AsTa: I need a child, but I need the mother to accept my seed williningly say yes  
Alize: ASTA THATS NOT A FAVOR  
AsTa:ok love we'll come back to it  
Agent: Excuse Me, Hello, One moment  
Mallory: Look I'm sorry I'm sure you have a really worthy cause but I just did a triple  
Agent: Then it pains me even more to be the one to give you this news, you are indeed Miss Mallory Brunson?

Jake: don't talk silly girl that's my nephew too, when's he coming?  
Mallory: next week  
Jake: we got time to prepare

. — . ..:. .  
Banging on the door like the police became necessary cause she could see shadows on the couch but no one was answering and she was feeling rage replace the sickness.  
Jackie: STOP FUCKING AND ANSWER THE FUCKING DOOR

Mallory: what the fuck  
Jake: hold on baby lemme handle it  
Mallory: what's wrong with   
Jake: it's ok lay down I got it

Jake: did I take all the sanity in the split what the fuck was that?  
Jackie: I've been knocking for some time, no one was answering, so all my polite went out the window  
Jake: is something wrong with your phone?  
Jackie: Huh?

Jake: you didn't call, you didn't text you just popped up, where's your spare key why didn't you let yourself in, until you started barking like a crazy person we had no idea it was even you out here, so whats going on Jacks, is it drugs like whats got you bugging out like this  
Jackie: I....................

. — . ..:.. .  
Jackie: I'm not crazy, I need to talk to you but I'm sorry I'm interrupting what the fuck ever you got going on goodbye  
Jake: Jackie  
Jackie: No goodbye, you may have took all the sanity but I guess I took all the compassion cause you weren't always a bastard  
Jake: Nigga 

Jackie: Don't worry about me, I get to go home and lay with a partner who I don't have secrets from, who knows Everything about me, can you say the same  
Jake: Oh yeah Real compassionate of you  
Jackie:pardon me just so used to the wonderful feeling of not lying you know  goodbye Jakieyboy 

. — . ..:.. .  
Dex: I've had my fill of this place I'm tired of the fish fucking the dog and the little pup walking around with his tail between his legs because the fucking witch is calling to him and that other fucking one that keeps running off to fuck his shifter bitch whose not even a shifter anymore all the clan rules get bent around here and I'm over it time to call in the muscle.

Dex: Daddy, I want to come home, no Daddy it's not fair, he'll never just "let me go" It'll make his clan look weak, and it'll inconvenience his little pregnant slut cause she'll have to start going to clan events and moving around and that baby is really starting to get big, but it's not fair daddy the contract should have been void the minute they mated.

Dex: He only needed me cause he had no mate, why can't I come home, why do I still have to be here, what bigger picture, if my misery is gonna be for some greater purpose you damn right I wanna know,................The Demons are always up to something, me leaving isn't going to weaken any alliance.

. — . ..:.. .  
Dex: If anything they'd lose out on us, cause they'd be damn stupid if they let our clan go, omg Daddy you know what, I should have never called you, I'm calling Nette, oh I do Dare, come get me or I'm calling my big sis to tell her I'm absolutely miserable isn't that the type of thing she'd be interested in hearing after coming home?

. — . ..:.. .  
Dex: See you soon Daddy, now to stir things up before my departure, fun, fun, fun, todays gonna be a very delightful day, oohh what are they about to get up to?

Elly: So what do you think  
Will: that you're the most beautiful woman I've ever met in my entire life  
Elly: About the Nursery fool, now that it's done, I didn't want it to be too fussy but I still wanted cute baby vibes

Will: I Love it, and I really can't wait to meet the tiny one  
Elly: you and me both cause I don't think I'm gonna last that long  
Will: well I've got good news for you, or little half breed may not take that long to cook........  
mubbles under his breathe "but could be up to .. pounds"

Elly: The fuck did you say?  
Will: You look delicious   
Elly: No what did you say  
Dex: WILLLLL

Will: BUSSYYYY  
Dex:MY FATHERS ON HIS WAY  
Will: baby, I'll be right back  
Elly: yeah, yeah I'm used to it, go handle your business, let me get back to plotting to kill you in your sleep  
Caleb: hey, how did it go  
Jackie: It didn't I hate them I hope I never seen them ever again  
Caleb: So those baby hormones huh  
Jackie: NO, He's AN ASSHOLE  
Caleb: really, think back now that it's just  the two of us 

Jackie: yea I went to the house  
Caleb: uhuh  
Jackie: and I..........  
Caleb: Yeah?  
Jackie: pregnancy sucks  
Caleb: want me to apologize for you?  
Jackie: yes and tell them why it's your fault 

AsTa: Couldn't resist the temptation to dress up could you boys?  
Amdusias: you gave us no information on where we were going to hold this unofficial meeting so we decided, why not we don't get many opportunity to be festive.  
AsTa: very true 

Purson: please do enlighten us

AsTa: This is the home of one Abigail Clearwater, she made a very simple deal with me pleasure and wealth in exchange she would give me a seed, Abigail though doesn't trust Demons so, she thought she would keep causing Misscrriages and calling them accidents,  
Purson: Ah she thought you a fool 

Abi: WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE AFTER YOU LEFT ME HIGH AND DRY WHile I WAS LOSING OUR BABY YOU SON OF A BITCH  
AsTa: Hello Abi  
Abi: You didn't have to leave we could have kept trying 

AsTa: You haven't changed still as beautiful  
Abi: you think so, come on we still got that deal right, you belong to me until I have a baby? cause I want a new addition to this house and like for real these bills were starting to pile up then, I feel like we can start working on twins what you think? 

AsTa: Come here I'll show you  
Abi: mmm Daddy I missed you Too  
AsTa: Good cause I've come to collect  
Abi: huh? 

Abigail didn't have time to scream all sound got caught in her throat the blade entered her back repeatedly and the intense pain faded until she slipped away and felt nothing at all, she stood there holding her lifeless body can ghost spit? she wanted to spit in his face. 

Amdusias: Do you feel better  
AsTa: I do, to think she would try and cheat me, and she may have almost gotten away with it, had it not been for this contract I currently have that gives me the freedom to continue to walk the earth realm  
Amdusias: Glorias, I shall play to your victory 

AsTa: you boast me  
Amdusias: You are worthy  
AsTa: I have one more trick up my sleeve we shall see if I can't make my heir on earth before Mammon 

Purson: Awefully brilliant idea, to stage that fight in front of his little pet but how are you so sure she passed the message on  
AsTa: I heard her do so myself, I was in luck to be on scene when she boasted how I prevented her from being eaten whole  
Purson: you really did, the act was only half, she looked yummy and I was Very, VERY hungry 

Malphas: speaking of can we eat her?  
AsTa: I don't see why not  
Purson: Oh yummy, she looks perfect  
Amdusias: Eh why not right, might as well enjoy ourselves, can't let you have all the fun 

Abi: No way are you fuckers really going to eat me?  
AsTa: well we aren't going to drink you  
Abi: disgusting, how inhumane can you be  
AsTa: Very, since you know I'm a demon and all 

AsTa: I'm sure whispers are spreading and gossip is spreading, But no one is a hundred percent sure what I'm doing, they know I have the girl but for what reason no one knows, and Mamon won't be worried, he's not who my mind lingers on.......... 

Drew: Something is coming we need to make some big moves  
Demetri: Explain  
Drew: I feel Asta took that girl for a bigger reason than just fun, he's hiding something, I feel we should go home and close the portals  
Demetri: What 

Drew: It's time, you have had enough fun sire and that girl has gave you now heir, we both know she's baren, we should kill her and return to our realm and meet with the full council to see who comes and what is said   
Demetri: You want to kill, Kimi  
Drew: Out of necessity   
Demetri: right, when she comes home 

Demetri, have ever the soft spot for HIS Kimiko immediately linked into her mind on her walk home  
Demetri: Do not come home it's no longer safe, Drew means to kill you, remember where the emergency locker is, go there I've left enough money for you to be very comfortable, I'll try and end this as soon as I can, if this outlasts your lifetime this world will burn.  
Kimi: I love you, Daddy  
Demetri: You're a good girl 

Mallory: you think he's gonna like us  
Jake: what's not to like we're great  
Mallory:Yeah  
Jake: WHy, is the duck in the bathtub   
Mallory: hah? 

Jake: if you can hah, you can hear  
Mallory: Whomp whomp  
Jake: you a little pain in my but you know that?  
Mallory: Maybe  
Jake: So Caleb called 

Mallory: Oh yeah what up  
Jake: Jackie's pregnant, that's why she was being so   
Mallory: NUTSO  
Jake: for lack of a better word  
Mallory: holly shit that's a lot 

Jake: We're gonna have a baby...................... but we're not only you, I never thought that, I knew, I just never imagined and now it's a fact and I still can't imagine, but, you're absolutely right I can't lay in bed every night next to someone I'm lying to, I have to tell Mallory the truth about me, about us   
Trinity: you smell that, that the smell of freedom  
Eric: ain't shit free about this country  
Trinity: whose talking about the country, I'm talking about being free from duty.  
Eric: I thought you liked the violence? what you got planned now that we're back on the mainland? 

Trinity: I like violence against those who deserve it, we weren't always going after those who deserve it though were we................I miss my baby sister, I'm going to go check on her make sure the Pack is doing well, how about you?  
Eric: I'm going to check on my  baby sisters too, I haven't spoken tto them in about three years  
Trinity: what the fuck 

Eric: The older one she doesn't believe in the war  
Trinity: Hippie  
Eric: Baptist  
Trinity: those religious types love violence more than me most times  
Eric: Not River, don't drink don't curse, don't fuck, read her bible and pray for humanity. 

Trinity: Jesus, I need a drink thinking about it  
Eric: I know, Alize's the opposite, the wildfire, she wanted to be an artist before then dimmed her light now she just wants to party and drink and that's why I dimmed his light......permanently.  
Trinity: that's how I am with my Dex, that my pudding, I'm really not above Genocide for her 

Eric: So are we gonna have a chance to keep in touch or you cutting me off like a bad habit?  
Trinity: I Don't see why we can't get a couple of drinks, you dragged my ass out of the flame   
Eric: I remember you dragging my ass out a lot more times though  
Trinity: Ehhh real friends don't keep count, this is me right here, ok see you around.  
Eric:See you round Nette 

Demetri: Why are we here  
Drew: Because since Kimiko did not come home I started doing some investigating  
The annoyance was clear on Demetri's face, Drew was like a dog without a bone digging and hunting refusing to give up Demetri raised his hands in exasperation.  
Demetri: we knew long ago she wasn't like the others she had no plans of fame and fortune she wanted no never-ending riches, just her family, she probably stacked enough after this last even and ran away. 

Drew: I thought so too till I came across him  
Demetri: WHOSE CHILD IS THAT  
Drew: He belongs to the sister of Alize, now I understand why AsTa wanted her  
Demetri: Oh please, HE WANTED HER FOR HIS PLEASURE, please don't cast doubt on one of my few Allies 

Drew: Okay, well if that is the case once he realizes what he has we'll see how loyal he really is to you.  
Demetri: and what exactly does he have? A whore with a nice body, we had one of those she ran away.  
Drew: You know what I like about this realm, I like video games, on particular game that I'm very fond of is Pokemon 

Demetri: Yes, I know of your love for the children's series  
Drew: You know Mamon, our world is very similar to the Pokemon  
Demetri: Point, please get to the point this suspense thing you're doing it's dragging. 

Drew: Well in our Realm instead of Didos we have witches and they don't just match power, they Amplify.  
Demetri: Wait, Wait hold on a sec  
Drew: This little guy is of Straight-wolf decent  
Demetri: HOW?  
Drew: Dido  
Demetri: I know Pure Werewolf That doesn't have this much pure energy, is his father an Alpha?  
Drew: No, some bleeding heart who saved his mother from becoming a sacrifice, The brother to a Minor Clan Alpha 

Demetri: So then How? So strong, I've seen witch offsprings that aren't this overpowered   
Drew: They come from some Clan that funny enough Icubo thought he wiped out for refusing to mate with him  
Demetri: I guess, these two got away  
Drew: That was a human century ago they would have to be the Clan's descendants I doubt Either of them know of their family's lineage. 

Demetri: Did you kill the babysitter  
Drew: No I don't want to cause any alarms or raise any flags for anyone until we know what's going on.  
Demetri: Very interesting my friend, very, very interesting, let's put this sweet little guy back and go visit my father, I'd like to council with an Elder on this matter. 

Trinity: It's so good to be home I can't wait to get out of this monkey suit and be around my babies mommies missed you all so much you must have all gotten so big, and talking about big, I've got to call Dex, oh man, my baby sis married what if she's prego, I can't wait to see her and meet the lucky guy......... and threaten his life and that of his entire family, family pets and everyone they've ever interacted with at any point pleasantly.

Trinity: Oh my baby Mommy missed you, our military gives us such a limited supply of weapons and they won't let us customize anything, it's so good to be home, I have so much work to do first let's start with everyone getting a cleaning from mommy ok no wait can't do that first lets call the fam and let them know that I've touched down, really not trying to hear daddies mouth about worried sick and blah di blah like I'm not the thing that goes bump in the night.

Trinity: Father, I'm home,  
Lucian: My........my Serefine it is good to hear you  
Trinity: Father No one calls me by my name not even you, what's going on  
Lucian: I need you to remain, Rational my child, mistakes were made but this must be handled diplomatically  
Trinity: Oh my this sounds bloody do explain 

. — . ..:.. .  
Lucian: Serefine  
Trinity: Stop  
Lucian: Then listen, the demons seem to be on the Move, the Vampires have been suspiciously silent, our new Mermaid Treaty is on shaky grounds, we don't need a blood bath, we need peace  
Trinity: So what is it that you are afraid of me hearing, please tell me before someone else does   
Lucian: Dex, seems to be unhappy with her new arranged marriage, since the groom, accidentally found his mate after the wedding  
Trinity: Accidentally 

Lucian: You know we don't control these things  
Trinity: Ok, so why doesn't he release Dex from her wife contract?  
Lucian: It's been a lot going on You will see when you rejoin the pack, if you can behave  
Trinity: I won't kill everybody just yet Daddy  
Lucian: Thank you, I will see you soon  
Trinity: Goodbye I think I hear an intruder  
Lucian: Poor soul 

. — . ..:.. .  
Mindy: Hey, how the fuck did you get in here  
Trinity: I was gonna ask you the same  
Mindy: I used the fence to the left but I've been crashing here for months you gotta find your own spot, Elvira  
Trinity: Excuse me?  
Mindy: No for real, whoever owns this spot they still have like a cleaning service and gardeners and all those people they'll catch us if its more than one person here

Mindy: So nice to meet you so sad it's so brief but bah bye  
Trinity: How bold of you to try and put me out of my own house  
Mindy: ...............No fucking way  
Trinity: oh big, big way girly, months you say, while I fought for our country, you enjoyed my home?

Trinity: How very bold of you  
Mindy: Stop that's not funny it's no way you're the owner of this house  
Trinity: Estate  
Mindy: What?

. — . ..:. .  
Trinity: A house A standalone dwelling that is typically located on a smaller plot of land in a residential neighborhood or urban setting whereas what I own is A large property that includes a main residence, gardens, recreational areas, and other buildings. Estates can be several acres in size and may include orchards, woodlands, and lawns. They can also have a self-sustaining living environment. Which had you the freedom to explore you would have seen.

. — . ..:.. .  
Mindy: Look I understand you may be a bit upset, but I destroyed no property and outside of a little food I didn't steal anything, your maid bitches cleaned up every day so it's like I wasn't here anyway, I'll just go no need to call the police or anything I'll just leave ok?  
Trinity: Ok  
Mindy took a deep breath, thank god, she'd run out of here and put this all behind her, but then her inhospitable host began to smile, a twisted smile that put knots in her stomach  
Trinity:Is that what you wanted me to say, you invaded my home no apology, no mercy, the same entitled energy

Mindy: Listen here ya little dominatrix leprechaun, I don't know if that's what you're into but I'm not groveling for anyone, this probably really isn't your house  
Trinity: What did you call me  
Mindy: You heard me, look at you, fucking freaky midget  
Trinity: I can't believe I was gonna be nice and call the cops on you, HA

Trinity: I'm not short bitch, you're just freakishly tall   
This couldn't be the same baby I just had was all River could think as she carried her .seven-pound bouncing over tired bundle of joy, he'd gotten so big in such a short time, and still all the things he seemed to be able to do were still very unreal to her, her little miracle boy.  
River: ok Papa Off to bed you go, so I can get some rest myself  
But her journey to her room was interrupted by her doorbell ringing.  
River: Alize, guess things fell under for her, No thats not nice maybe she just missed us 

But it wasn't Alize at the door it was a visit she had been dreading even though they hadn't spoken in years at least she knew he was Alive now with this soldier standing at the door she knew what this meant they came to tell her that her brother was gone, how she was still standing she didn't know what was holding back the tears, The soldiers still had his back turned to her she didn't think he knew the door was open and she wasn't sure how to alert him to her presence. 

Was this a friend of Eric's maybe he was torn up about the whole thing, perhaps she should clear her throat, her mind was racing a mile a minute wanting to hurry up and get the news but wanting to put it off for as long as humanly possible if time wanted to freeze right now she wouldn't mind but it wouldn't because it couldn't so she cleared her throat audible enough that it brought the solider in front of her back from whatever war he was in because her responded with a slight jump. 

Eric: Whats up Dead Sea  
Tears were streaming, she had prepared herself for the worst now that the best possible gift was on her front step she couldn't contain the well inside her.  
River: Eric?  
Eric: Who else, I know I'm a little dirty but  
she jumped full force into her brother's arms. 

River: I was so worried about you, you been gone so long and you stopped writing  
Eric: You said you didn't wanna hear about my life of sin   
River: you were writing about actual combat butt head oh my God thank you jesus for bringing him home lord thank you GOD  
Eric: I Missed you too Dead sea, where's Zae? 

River: She lives in a high rise across town  
Eric: Oh shit, ok heard you girl  
River: With her Boyfriend  
Eric: Oh no, is it like that other one?  
River: I honestly don't know, she's been pretty busy he keeps her out of trouble they just came back from Peru, he convinced her to take classes I really don't know what to think, I'm skeptical cause I never see her, but things honestly seem to be good. 

Eric: Well lets give her the benefit of the doubt right baby sis doing good we don't got to wory as hard how about you, I don't see a ring none of them church boys good enough for you  
River: I have a son  
Eric: Nigga, repeat yo self  
River: It's a long story  
Eric: the war is over, explain that to me when did holy hell. 

River: I don't........ok I'm going to bandaid this so one night I was coming home from a rival at a sister church and I got attacked in an alley by a bunch of men, I was Saved though by some wild animals who ripped up my attackers and this guy who found me bleeding out in the alley, he got me to safety and got me some help, later I found out about Michael, my son who funny enough I named Michael cause I was sure it was the Angel Michael who saved me in the Alley but it turns out I was just loopy and He must have been wearing his name tag cause I just met my rescuer and his name is Michael.  
Eric: Woah  
River: Uh YEah  
Eric: Rivs, I'm so sorry  
River: It's ok, god gives his hardest battles to his strongest soldiers  
Eric: Ok Rambo, well show me where I can get cleaned up  
River: of course come on in 

Jake: Baby you Home?  
Mallory: In the C-drama room  
Jake: Normal people refer to it as the Living room  
Mallory: Normal is boring, who ever just wants to be normal?  
Jake: Ok well, I hope it's not getting good I need you to pause it real quick so we can talk. 

Mallory: hey big guy you good?  
Jake: yeah, just went to check on Jackie  
Mallory: oh how is Prego doing  
Jake: Good, moody, she was crying about the grass being fall green which means summer is ending.  
Mallory: Damn 

Jake: Yeah Pregnancy does sound wild  
Mallory: So I'm sure that's not what you wanted to talk about.  
Jake: You're right........ no beating round the bush with you huh?  
Mallory: thats ya problem you love beating around the bush too much, you love beating around the bush so much it took you forever to actually beat the damn bush. 

Jake: Cold  
Mallory: But Factual  
Jake: Ok, so umm it's about me....and Jackie  
Mallory: Oh god please no twincest  
Jake: Ummm no actually see it's about the twin thing, we aren't actually Twins, we're shifters well I was a shifter, we were one after a life of constant issues we decided to try separation Magic after a super painful process, we live separately. 

Mallory: shifters?  
Jake: Yeah, baby I'm sorry I should have told you sooner I can understand if you need time and I just want you to know I'm ready for your anger I still love you  
Mallory: that's why you eat pussy so good you used to have one  
Jake: come here 

Mallory: you hungry right now  
Jake: I'm always hungry  
Mallory: I Love to hear it  
Jake: Whens the baby coming again I gotta take advantage of all the open area sexing I can get from now 

. — . ..:.. .  
Will: What’s this about Lucian? In wolf form no Les, I assure you no one here is a threat to you  
Lucian: that question is insulting because there would only be one reason I would personally come to you, ignorance does not become you my friend as for my form when you become an old dog like myself you will see you don’t really have control over when and where you change.  
Will: Dex have I displeased you? 

Dex: Father, I just want to go  
Lucian: You are his wife I can’t simply come in and remove you from his home, the meeting must be held. Grievances must be laid out. The man must be given a chance to state his case.  
Dex: what case, I am in the house with two mated wolves and a possible. You can smell their mates on them. It’s evident and strong.  
Trinity: three  
Dex: You would know 

Trinity: Very strong, it looks like this house likes to mix it up. No one here’s mated to another wolf.  
Mike: Loud and wrong tiny pup I do not have a mate, maybe it’s best you let the grownups work things out.  
Lucian: Right how rude of me, this is my Eldest daughter Serefine, she was away at war these past two years which is why she missed the wedding. 

Caleb: I’m unfamiliar with that name  
Trinity: you can call me Trinity  
Caleb: That name I know  
Mike: I still don’t know her  
Caleb: And u don’t want to trust me.  
Mike: what’s so scary about Thumbalina 

Trinity: Daddy?  
Lucian: envision the word mercy today my daughter, these are our Allies, we came to speak and fix what has become an old man’s grave mistake, this very young insolent child meant no disrespect, am I right William.  
Will: you are correct my brother gets very, thoughtless and he’s learning forgive him. 

Mike: Ok OK, you may be some big bad scary motherfucker and I'm miss judging you because of your size. I apologize for that you’re still wrong. I’m not mated to anyone.  
Trinity: How old are you? Forget that the failures are not yours alone, has no one told you or are you denying her? I’m so very confused right now.  
Mike: So am I, I’ve never marked anyone, how could I deny someone I’ve marked?  
Trinity: you ponytail tell him  
Caleb: The mating mark is just the final step kind of like a ceremony complete 

Mike:……What?  
Trinity: that poor girl walking around in this big bad world the smell of you all over her and no you in sight to protect her, I mean good for lesser weaker beings who will smell you and run but for those who are looking for a fight…..,,  
Mike: WHY WOULDN’T ANYONE TELL ME,   
Caleb:Michael  
Trinity: oh look the puppies mad 

Will: Mike we weren’t sure, we were still trying to investigate.  
Mike: so how is she so sure?  
Will: because little brother, the young lady you seem so intent to sacrifice your life to is the thing that goes bump in the night she’s the reason why we have strict breeding guidelines now, you weren’t born yet and I was still a puppy but I remember how close we came to war different clans trying to lay claim to this new breed 

Mike:So she’s a Mutt?   
Trinity: She’s right here and this, is getting rude  
Will: Again apologies this entire meeting is a bit...........out of the norm, informal  
Lucian: Well it's usually me and my guard, considering I was already bringing Serefine I thought the Guard would be overkill................honestly bringing her for security was overkill but she refused to stay away.  
Mike: So you can't control her 

Trinity: Daddy?  
Lucian: NO  
Mike: I stand corrected  
Dex: Bold of you to think just cause you safe now you safe forever, she on a leash now.  
Dex's loud laugh made Michael grit his teeth, and a slight twinge of fear entered him.  
Will: I'm sorry this arrangement has displeased you, my wife, I grant you temporary leave to council, if you feel the same when we reconvene then we can disolve the marriage  
Dex: Whatever buy your time. goodbye 

Eric: I gotta say the house is real nice sis  
River: Thanks I try, how did you sleep?  
Eric: Good, so where's the little man?  
River: upstairs still sleeping, he had a rough night surprise he didn't wake you 

Eric: that was my first real bed in . years the second coming of christ couldn't wake me   
River: Funny  
Eric: So think I'll get to see my baby, baby sister today  
River: oh yeah I did message her last night let me hit her up again and see if she can spare some time for her family, she hasn't seen Mikey in a while too it'll be nice 

Eric: Maybe she can bring her new "love" interest over to meet the family as well since they are getting serious  
River: doubtful, but who knows, she doesn't usually go for the ones who want to meet family except the one doctor she messed things up with but like I said who knows this one may be different, he seems to be pushing her to better herself so who knows let's see  
Eric: It would be bittersweet to see you both married off in love and living happily ever after  
River: If god sees fit   
Trinity: Girl I've been looking all over for you, what you doing   
Dex: Grumble  
Trinity: you don't wanna wait for the divorce to finalize before you start dating?  
Dex: Nope  
Trinity: ok well lets go out, I haven't had my cookies ate in three years we out  
Dex: YESSSSSS

AsTa: what troubles you  
Alize: I'm cool it's just family stuff is all  
AsTa: Oh?  
Alize: Nah fa real it's nothing   
AsTa: so why do you look so pensive?

Alize: Why you always use big words with me?  
AsTa: Because I'm not a fool  
Alize: ok yeah, you know them....but  
AsTa: don't speak falsely to me, don't dwell with liars   
Alize: and honest to god Demon, look at that  
AsTa: I know very well what you are capable of versus the show you put on for everyone else, but I have no need for performances now speak your peace

Alize: My brother is back from the military and I was going to go see him  
AsTa: I didn't know you had a brother   
Alize: to tell the truth I didn't know I still had one either I thought the motherfucker was dead we ain't heard from him in bout . years   
Astaroth couldn't help but laugh, a brother huh, very likely. he wondered who would die first, her or her habits..

AsTa: So let me guess, you want a couple of days to go see and spend time with this brother am I right  
Alize: Ah NO, he's staying at Rivers I'm good  
AsTa: Surely you don't wish to have him stay here?  
Alize: No, that's not the problem where he's staying is fine.....................................  
AsTa: Spit it out

AsTa: your sister the Witch?  
Alize: What you got the wrong girl

. — . ..:.. .  
Dex: soooooooooo  
Trinity:yes?  
Dex: I just know you ain’t flew me out to sit around?  
Trinity: it’s a ghost town love the real fun happens at night 

Dex: ohhh, so what we do until then  
Trinity: we can go over ground rules  
Dex: oh my god Trin we are not kids anymore  
Trinity: no leaving with sketchy niggas 

Dex: but sketchy niggas have the best dick  
Trinity: keep your location on  
Dex: yes daddy  
Trinity: you wish, my dick big as fuck  
Dex: ok gross incest much?  
Trinity: only on daddy’s side 

Dex: I got a rule for you  
Trinity: what?  
Dex: no pegging innocent young men who only want to suck your toes 

Trinity: it was a fair trade what you mean  
Dex: no traumatizing niggas for wanting to smash  
Trinity: that’s a silly rule they enjoy the trauma  
Dex: they ENJOY THE TRAUMAS……………. Ok goodbye 

Dex: ok I’m on the hunt cause Right\! I’m tired of these high yellow antics  
Trinity: do you own NO MIRORS?   
Dex: The men it’s a difference, look I’m just looking for chocolate and strong who wanna make love all night long  
listening ears smiled, whose he not to give the lady what she desires. 

Kiki:Sota who is at the door  
Drew: an uninvited  
Kikiyo: close the door boy don’t just let anyone in  
Sota: I haven’t  gotten up off the couch I didn’t open the door 

Kikiyo: how are you in my house beast no one invited you you should not be in here  
Drew: you’re thinking of vampires old woman I’m a demon I can go WHEREVER I please except in your body. 

Drew: go to the kitchen hold your breath till you die.  
Kikiyo: NO, he’s only a baby  
Drew thought I was being nice, doesn’t have to watch his family. Die and not as bad as what’s coming your way 

Kikyo: Leave  
Drew: as soon as I’m finished  
Kikyo: leave her alone, she’s changed, she’s a good girl please take me, you’ve taken my son.  
Drew: I came to take out the whole family and I intend to. 

Drew: Heaven with and intervention I think not, flames of hell consume her. 

Drew took a moment to sit back and look at his handiwork. It was starting to lift his mood. He was starting to feel better a little better, but his ultimate Prize is upstairs and surprisingly enough from what he could hear still fast asleep, completely unaware. 

Drew: I couldn’t imagine blissfully sleeping while my mother screams in agony and my only brother grows cold on the floor oh no, someone must alert the poor girl.  
he loudly sang as he ascended the stairs.  
Drew: I can't seem to face up to the facts  
I'm tense and nervous and I can't relax  
I can't sleep 'cause my bed's on fire  
Don't touch me, I'm a real live wire  
Psycho Killer  
Qu'est-ce que c'est?  
Fa-fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa, better  
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run away, oh-oh-oh  
Psycho Killer 

Dex: ummm excuse me sir do you know what personal space is  
Ale: no educate me  
Dex: it’s when you and   
how was she expected to make words with count chocula so close to her his, lips rocking ever so slightly from being a hair strand away from hers. 

Dex: I know words  
Ale: I’m sure you do  
Dex: at least tell me your name   
Ale: Alejandro, but you can call me Ale  
Dex: Ale?   
Ale: yes Dex, Ale it’s what my friends call me, if I had friends 

Dex: so you think I’m your friend?   
Ale: you don’t want to be my friend?  
she had to pause friend, she couldn't think of a single friend who'd applied this kind of pressure on her before.  
Dex: I don’t know what I want, you making it hard to think  
Ale: since the moment you and the little loud mouth walked in here, this is all I could think of. 

Her inside voices were screaming the problem was they were screaming two different things, one was screaming Danger run, you don't know him, he's an unknown vamp DUMB BITCH ARE YOU GIVING HIM YOUR NECK, and the other was screaming LET HIM EAT YOU SOMEBODY NEEDS TO, LET HIM KNOCK THE COBWEBS OFF THIS PUSSY, IT'S TIME. 

Ale: you make control...........difficult  
Dex: MMM  
Ale: I wonder if you taste as good as you smell cause you smell intoxicating  
Dex: Only one thing to do  
Ale: Whats that  
Dex: fuck around and find out 

Maybe Vampires needed invitations for everything because as soon as she said that he closed in, and there goes the world, Dex wasn't sure where she was floating to but she was gone, this was a level of passion surpassing what she was craving, she just wanted some dick, why was he exploring her mouth with his tongue and her body with his hands. 

Dex: I thought you were never going to let me up for air  
Ale: Is breathing really that essential?  
Dex: For us Mortals yes, stronger longs doesn't mean I don't need to breathe   
Ale: Noted for next time  
Dex: Next time? 

Ale: You would believe me satisfied with a kiss?  
Dex: I.....  
He pulled her even closer against his body so she could feel his current problem fighting to free itself.  
Ale: I just assumed you wouldn't appreciate me, discarding your clothes and devouring you in front of these very nice people  
Dex: they don't deserve the show  
Ale: shall we go  
Dex: Umm,,,,,,,  
That alarm voice was now a whisper and against her every better judgment she nodded, fuck it you only live once right, sorry Trin. 

Demetri: STOP  
Drew: MAMON no this is my right  
Demetri: You have no right, you had no right to kill her family and you have no right to take her life, her contract was with me and nowhere did she violate it, these are the murders of a jilted lover not that of a wronged Demon  
Drew: She Left when we were so close to the goal 

Demetri: her contract had no clause for her stay length and you planned to end her life before that time anyway  
Drew: THat is NOT the   
Demetri: I SAID NO  
Kimi: Drew, why are you here what are you doing here, what's going on, who are you yelling at  
Drew: SHUT UP, get dressed 

scrambling out of bed heart racing a mile a minute, Kimiko was five stages beyond confusion, why was Drew here, how did he find her, had Demetri had a change of heart, could she get him out of here without alerting her family.  
Kimi: I'm sorry I left, do what you want to me, please, please don't hurt my family.  
Drew: I think this is gonna feel better than killing you 

Walking over he opened the  door, wanted her to hear the sounds of her mother screaming and smell the flames charing her skin, but the silly girl kept trying to run out to her,  
Drew: He said I couldn't kill you, but I don't have to kill you to punish you  
Before She had time to process the words she felt the first blow, then again, she'd been beaten before, she messed with humans who behaved like demons before Demetri but they usually stayed away from her face, now nowhere was spared. 

Drew: This was almost Therapeutic, change you got blood on your clothes  
Kimiko:yes  
Gone and it was all her fault now she was just a lonely orphan no mom, no dad, no Sota, she got them killed not dad. Still, she might as well have, all she did was destroy beautiful things, she should have left them where they were they may not have been the happiest people in the world but at least they weren't brought out to slaughter, I hope this monster just kills me too, was her only repeating thought. 

Trinity: Father  
Lucian: Serefine  
Trinity: Yes Father we must talk  
Lucian: oh no, now I know somethings wrong what happened who died   
Trinity: Well the thing is  
Lucian: Where's your sister 

Trinity: Father May I finish  
Lucian: Make it fast  
Trinity: I'm trying really hard to hold in Serefine, everyone thinks Trinity's the monster because they don't know Serefine, that bastard took my baby sister from under my nose and tried to wipe his scent which meant he had no plans on anyone knowing where she is. 

Lucian: But you found him  
Trinity: Childs play  
Lucian: but he's not dead so where did it get complicated  
Trinity: He's a vampire  
Lucian: WHAT\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\! 

. — . ..:.. .  
Trinity: she went with him willingly   
Lucian: NO\!\!\! Why??  
Trinity: You left her with a clan where she was starved of love for . years Father, I'm sure he received no fight  
Lucian: She's still alive, yes, he's.....................entertaining her, if not for the fact I believe he has no intention of releasing her I'd let her have her fun. 

Lucian: Fuck the Treaty get your sister, bring back up so you don't go completely off the walls  
Trinity: You will not come?  
Lucian: No I have to call the council and alert them of what is about to transpire, this could be a breach of the treaty, but this is my child.  
Trinty: I'll handle it 

Drew: Don't look so upset I brought you a gift  
Demetri: You were out of line   
Drew: What line should I be walking Mamon, have you forgotten our reason for being here, have you forgotten the Prophecy Enepsigos predicted that Solomon’s kingdom will be divided that the Temple of Jerusalem will be destroyed and the tools in the temple will be used to serve other gods. The vessels used to trap all the demons will be broken by the birth of new men, and the freed demons will go throughout the world. 

Demetri: You Do not need to recite ancient Prophecies for me I know the word  
Drew: but did you know the tools that were in the temple were  the Witches, you are still in luck, MY ONLY REASONING for not slaughtering the girl and suffering your wrath, is because upon burning her mother I realized what that impure smell we always got from her was, she's not part fairy, she's part witch, I'm sure the prophecy is why Astaroth took Alize, but from what I can tell he has not gotten her consent to a child we still have time.  
Demetri: You slaughtered her family without provocation and expect her to agree to give me a child.  
Drew: Out with the old and in with the new, promise her a family no one can do what I just did ever again 

Kimi: DEMETRI\!\!\!  
He pulled her into his arms onto the bed but in a manner, he never had to before, holding her as her entire body rocked tears flowing so freely, you might expect a flood, he held her tight letting her feel his presence, you aren't alone, he didn't want that wave of loneliness to creep in.  
Demetri: I'm here, I'll always be here for you 

Kimi: It's all my fault  
Demetri: No  
Kimi: It is, I should have stayed away I brought a monster into their life and he took their life, and it's my fault and  
Demetri: You are not to blame, this is not on you if anything the blame is my own and I'm truly sorry. 

Kimi: No Demetri, you saved me............Twice  
Demetri: But if I had conceded the first time with how much you truly meant to me I would have told Drekavac you were not to be harmed under any circumstances....................  
Kimi: I'm sorry  
Demetri: Just rest, I'll be here 

Kimi: I never wanted to leave you  
Demetri: HMM?  
Kimi: I wanted my family but I never wanted to leave your side, if you didn't tell me to run I wouldn't have left I meant it when I said I'd follow you home to the gates of hell and sleep happily forever at the foot of your throne.  
Demetri: What about by my side? 

Trinity walked into the room knowing she was coming to be a buzzkill but it wasn't personal it was business, Walking into the room you got hit with a strong wiff of bounce that ass you couldn't tell where dick end and pussy or mouth began, she couldn't even see Tasia but she knew she was in there somewhere, Riri had Aj in the mouth and Brady in the back, and two under her ok that must be Deo and Tasia. 

Trinity: Deo I need your help, come up for air  
The pile rotated a bit but no one stopped, frustration levels started to climb so before she did something she would regret in a room full of friends she decided to speak on the matter.  
Trinity: The took Dex 

Riri paused and let Aj's dick slop out her mouth.  
Riri: Bullshit, everybody would be dead already aint noway you standing here all calm, and telling us they took yo human security blanket  
Trinity: It's complicated, he's a Vampire, we have a truce and she technically went with him at a party, but as he left he tried to hide all trace of their scent away so they couldn't be traced 

Deo: oh Nah nigga thats Sus as fuck hold on I'm getting dressed now, he really that big bad you need help?  
Trinity: No you're coming to babysit me, the blood lust gets a little out of hand when I'm emotional, you're one of my few friends who can pull me back to me, and Father said not to get carried away  
Deo: Ok copy that, let me wash the stank off  
Trinity: I'll be outside 

Deo: Can I Help you?  
Trinity: she been out here preaching about   
Cuntah: I KNOW WHAT YOU DO INSIDE YOUR SEX PARTIES AND YOU WORSHIP THE DEVIL  
Trinity: That she keeps saying that   
Cuntah: Sinners, fornicators, heathens 

Aj: Niggas don't forget we niggas too  
Deo: Mam how are we personally affecting you  
Cuntah: you bring the devil into our homes  
Trinity: She saw ya'll fucking one night now it's all she thinks of she standing right now pussy leaking can't even think her psychobabble straight she wants one of ya'll to fuck her so bad  
Deo: Aj you got this?   
Aj: Fuck no I'll ask Brian he likes em crazy 

Riri: Aww BB you so sweet out here doing charity work  
Brian: You like that  
Cuntah: Yes I will be your satan bride, it feels good my lord  
Riri: Oooooh baby you better never try and leave this one she may try and body bag yo ass HAHAAAAAAAAA

How it started.  
Dex: look I mayyy have been a little irrational running off with you but I don’t want you to think I’m always doing shit like this ok I’m just…………..  
Ale: in a delicate mind frame due to a stressful situation so you let a complete stranger take advantage of you  
Dex: you want some pussy or you Wanna get slapped? 

Ale: Please do, I do so love to play rough  
Dex: god damn you  
Ale: yes he did, a long time ago  
Dex: everyone will be so worried maybe a couple hours then I’ll go home  
Ale: whenever you’re ready 

VS How it’s going.  
Dex: I Really need to call home at least, it's been three days  
Ale: Are you ready to leave?  
Dex:............  
Ale: That's why you haven't called you know as well as I do once they know where you are you'll be made to leave 

Dex: Yeah, but they can't make me leave forever   
Ale: Forever is just built up of moments, but a moment without you feels like forever.  
Dex: Why is that true, why do I feel like I won't be able to breathe when I'm no longer around you? 

Ale: You won't have to find out  
Dex:No?  
Ale: not if I can help it  
Dex: My one-woman army is probably looking to come kick down your door right now and whoop my ass for this betrayal.  
Ale: I've placed enough distractions up to keep your sister busy as for this ass I'm the only one allowed to lay hands on it  
Dex: I Can't believe I've just been here letting you lick, suck bend and bruck me, meanwhile my sister and my Daddy are out there worried sick. 

Ale: Excuse me?  
Dex: My Dad I meant my Dad  
Ale: did you  
Dex: yes I'm sorry Daddy, I meant my Dad not another man  
Ale: I'm starting to feel like you need a more thorough lesson on the difference in the two 

Ale: you only get one Daddy, I only need one baby girl you understand?  
Dex: yes Daddy  
Ale: Are you my good girl?  
Dex: Yes daddy 

Three Days, Three days, and every time he slid in Dex felt like there was no way he could fit but somehow he always did, He would take his time and slide in till she could feel his balls at her pussy and then he'd fucking growl, and she knew he was about to do the absolute most. 

The Man was fucking her like it was an Olympic sport and he belonged to one of the countries that execute ya family if he didn't bring home the gold, every inch of her had been licked on fucked on, or sucked on these past three days and it was unraveling her sanity. 

Ale: You feel so good baby you want to come again  
Dex: YESS\!\!\!  
Ale: Cum for Daddy baby, cum on this dick, let me use it to fuck you harder  
And just like that my pussies twitching and I"m cumming and I swear the well is dry and I can't cum anymore and he twists pinch or touch something and I'm losing myself all over again. 

Ale: Mine, all of you every part of your mind, body, and soul belong to me  and I won't relinquish you, you know this right  
Dex: Yes  
Ale: Yes?  
Dex: Daddy, Yes Daddy  
shit he was just about to cum now he's never gonna stop RIP to this pussy she was a soldier, she died doing what she loved. 

Trinity: I think you can just wait here she's not in here  
Deo: Decoy?  
Trinity: Yup, and when the Q\&A starts a lovely young lady they kidnapped and have been using for sun-up food will come running out feel free to help her out for me  
Deo: Sun-up food is illegal, thats what plasma packs are for 

Trinity: you know I don't kill saints Deo If I come for you then you're probably an evil little shit, these fuckers deserve everything I'm about to do  
Deo: you gonna do the thing...... she's gonna do the thing 

I am the punishment of God... 

.If you had not committed great sins, 

God would not have sent a punishment like me upon you. 

Trinity:Bitch 

Vampire: A bloody fairy?  
Trinity: FUCK YOU\!\! 

Igor: Mistress, Mistress wait, My master has sent me with a Message Mistress please about your sister  
Trinity: whose, your Master  
Igor: I'm unsure I was only just created for this message and promised to be spared if I delivered 

Trinity: Speak quickly   
Igor: He says your sister is safe and he has made an offering to your blood lust now you may find them in a forgotten hollow but he is not inviting you into his home to fight, he is welcoming you as a guest, and the sister to his future mate.  
Trinity: Oh he got balls, I like that, I'm gonna kill him slow 

Trinity: “It is not sufficient that I succeed \- all others must fail.” Genghis Khan 

It’s the cuddles for me, the pets, the kisses dare I even say the love or better worded the loving acts, If it was just the fucking I probably would have gone home the next morning because don’t get me wrong. 

I wouldn’t be gone for long because never have I ever been fucked so properly in my entire life, 

But the aftercare I’m so glad I don’t know any family secrets cause they’d be fucked, we be talking about everything and any thing, for hours. 

We go from,  
Ale: You gonna take this dick like my good girl?  
Ass slapping and coochie pounding to just. 

Locked in maybe kissing maybe talking maybe just being creepy and looking into each others eyes trying to see how far we can see into the others soul. 

\*Four days now and I feel like I’ve known him forever 

Trinity: I just know this nigga out here collecting redheaded baddies, he gotta because I just KNOW, this ain't my little sister I'm looking at in this window, this bitch half naked cleaning up smiling looking like motherfucking superhead meets martha stewart the fuck is going on here.

Jake: It's ok

The toddler had just come into some of his powers object teleportation was one of which he used very often so no, was often a word lost in translation because the toddler would just summon what he wanted anyway.

. — . ..:.. .  
Mallory: Look hun, we've had this talk you can't splash paint all over the floor  
Glactin: YAYYYYY

Mallory: How are you handling this so well and I'm not, he's my blood and I just don't feel that connection I just feel........Tired

Jake: And that's ok, most moms get to ease into this stage they get cute newborns, soft infants, you got tossed right into terrible two's love that's not an easy ride, with a bay whose never met you before, who just lost his mom, who just recovered from a life-threatening condition, you're doing better than most.  
Mallory: I don't feel like it

Alize: Can I ask you something  
River: yeah  
Alize: Do you regret being a mom  
Will: You just couldn't take your mom's complexion huh? She Really didn't like me her Whole Pregnancy I couldn't deny you if I wanted to, I thought cloning hadn't been approved yet, how'd she get away with this, you laughing, Daddies funny, daddies funny little guy?

Looking down, he couldn't believe after all the bullshit some calm had settled back into his life and he could finally breathe easy. Soon Dex would return they would dissolve the marriage and be free of that ugly mess and everything would be finally over with. 

The Past weeks He'd done everything in his power to show his Elly, she was his everything and he needed nothing but her, the tiny bundle in his arms eyes started to close so he gently placed him in his Bassinet.

No sooner than he put the baby down his phone began to Ring.  
Will: Go for Will  
Thalos:Brother I Greet you first but the news I bear is not good  
Will: is it ever, you're like my personal omen for a shit storm, so what has happened now, what great stress has come to rock my peace, did little Timmy fall down the well? 

Thalos: Glad you can find mockery still in the situation  
Will: I can do so because you haven't opened up your mouth and told me what the fuck has happened yet  
Thalos: Your wife has finally found her mate  
Will: What, but that's great, she can be his beast of burden and the marriage can be dissolved with great pea  
Thalos: HE'S A VAMPIRE  
Will: No 

Thalos: Yes, she's been missing for the past four days, she was captured by a cold walker and he's claimed her as his mate  
Will: She fucked a filthy bloodsucker, disgusting   
Thalos: to think she could stomach the smell of death on him  
Will: She's related to death the smell must be second nature, but I cannot let her shame us and be mated to a death dealer.  
Thalos: I knew you would do right, Lucian in his old age is letting those girls run free, I heard Trinity took out an Entire Vampire Clan looking for her sister  
Will: Will this mean war?  
Thalos: No they were shameful impersonating some old royal bloodline, but now she has your little fangbanger when they get back deal with her I'll fix her sister for you. 

Mallory: Hey girl how you feeling  
Jackie: Pregnant  
Mallory:Damn son is almost over  
Jackie: Thankfully, It's only taking so long Cause the fathers part Wolfy, shifter pregnancies don't usually take this long, like . to . months tops this shit is for the birds

Mallory: . to . months which Ancestral Gods dick did ya'll suck for that deal I thought we had it sweet with . months ya'll got it good as fuck.  
Jackie: depends how bout you how are you feeling?  
Mallory: Rough, it's fucking rough and I don't know Jake is handling this so fucking well but I'm at my last nerve and I don't know what else to do, he doesn't sleep, his favorite thing to do is destroy my house and he learned a new word................... fuck, after I hit my toe on the fucking tv unit I screamed fucked and he would randomly scream fuck everywhere for a week

\*Jackie couldn't help but chuckle a bit picturing the little terror  
Mallory: I'd laugh too honestly, I just never realized how much these situations could be until now I'm in the shit and the problem is I wasn't even sure I wanted to be a mom before and now I don't have a choice because I Can't give him back, and does it make me a bad person to say sometimes I wish I could like sometimes he's so sweet and cute and you just wanna hug him and other time it's Turn down for what.  
Jackie: Shit, that is really heavy love

Mallory: and I keep thinking What would I do if I got pregnant right now I can't handle another baby on top of him so does that mean that my baby has to die how is that fair to me and Jake, but also I know I'd go insane with another one around.  
Jackie well one lucky thing then is you don't have to worry about that male shifters can't reproduce they don't have the ability.  
Mallory: wait what  
Jackie: I mean that's good right, one less worry

. — . ..:.. .  
Mike: You came, I'm glad I wasn't really sure you would  
River: I wasn't really sure I would either, I was shocked when you called   
Mike: I was hoping you would come by again but impatience struck me so I decided to make use of your number, you did say after last time you wanted to keep in touch.  
River's mind was racing back to how much after the last time her body sinfully craved his touch, but she couldn't punish her savior for her filthy mind. 

River: Sorry A lot has been going on my brother just came back from duty  
And I've been running away from my dirty feelings about you is the other half of the truth she thought as she sat down hoping this time would be different.  
Mike: Welcome home to him thanks to his service 

River: So what's up  
Mike: Right to the point huh  
River: you sounded, worried on the phone, it's one of the reasons I found a sitter so quick and came so umm yeah  
Mike:This Is all going to sound like one very wild ride and you may never talk to me after which I don't even know how I'll handle that but I guess let's go right? 

River: I'm Sure it's not all that bad  
Mike: I'm a werewolf my family has found proof that you are from a witch clan  
River: Would you look at that I was wrong, excuse me what?  
Mike: and the reason why I reacted so strongly is because my inner beast recognized you as my Mate and slaughtered those men to try and rescue you but when I embraced you, you became with child  
River: Did Alize put you up to this because it's not very funny 

Mike: Who?  
River: Look my church has an excellent ..-step program love  
Mike: I'm not on drugs  
River: You got to be if you expect me to believe anything you just said  
Mike: I can prove it, let's go get a DNA test  
River: YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE  
Mike: AND THE VIDEO  
River: huh  
Mike: I mean the Attack happened right outside my Clan brothers club it's why I was there the bastard has a full video of me transforming ripping the guys up picking you up and calling the police.  
River: I wonder if this is a satan dream too 

Alize: Awwww look at the lazy baby, you fell asleep crawling around, all you had to do was crawl a little you so tired, My cute little stink butt, you really out here getting big on me, is this what ya'll do, come through and get big, wild as fuck

Alize: No, I'm sorry, I thought you would be tired 

Eric: I'm good just on this job-hunting move  
Alize: You don't wanna work for the Feds no more?  
Eric: Nah I'm sick of the Violence, what about you what's up, you been a round a lot more what happened with ya mister man  
Alize: We split up  
Eric: Wait what? so where you been I thought you lived with him? 

. — . ..:.. AM  
Alize: I got my own place before I left him  
Eric: What did he Do  
Alize: He kept pressuring me to have a baby   
Eric: I'm sorry love, but you know sometimes these older guys when they don't have any kids and they see a pretty young girl like you they just go stir crazy, He'll come around

Alize: Yeah but I won't, that motherfucker tried to set me up  
Eric: Do I need to go get my gun  
Alize: If I tell you the whole story you have to promise not to tell River ok  
Eric: That bad huh?  
Alize:??????  
Eric: OKay, ok

. — . ..:.. AM  
So You remember the day I went with River to go to her date that wasn't a date that was a date that may be a date, I was hiding and listening to him tell her all these things that his clan had found out about our Family how Grandma was from a Really strong Coven of witches and this Demon wanted to mate with one of them when they turned him, he came back with his buddies to slaughter the coven, and Grandma escaped pregnant with mommy.

Alize: But then Grandma died in childbirth and the Jesus freaks adopted mommy and that's why we all had no idea, so all of that made a lot of sense but ok so AsTa's a demon  
Eric: Nigga WHAT  
Alize: and he knew River was a witch at least he said something like that to me before so I was like fuck this he up to something and I went home and ended the contract.

. — . ..:.. AM  
The next thing I Know I'm at some fucking dude ranch around a bunch of his buddies, I was fucking SHOOK but I wasn't bout to put on and let these motherfuckers get the best of me so you know me I Put my chest up and I did my best at being brave.

Alize: Where the fuck am I and where the fuck is the nearest bus stop  
Purson: You are at the feeding ranch and just in time for lunch  
Alize: I'm not hungry  
Purson: No, but you're about to be stuffed since You are on the menu

. — . ..:.. AM  
Alize: I think the fuck not  
Amdusias: Watch out this meal may not be an easy Purson  
Purson: Delicious nonetheless  
Alize: Fuck ya'll I'm not dumb

Purson: Could have fooled me  
Alize: Ya MOTHA  
throwing a cup of her homemade fire sauce she always kept in her coat for unseasoned food, may not of hurt but she felt better.  
Sukuna: Now you've done it  
Alize: You Can't Kill ME I NEVER MADE NO CONTRACTS WITH NONE A YOU MOTHER FUCKERS AND IT'S NO DEMON FREE FOR ALL TIME

. — . ..:.. AM  
Before I knew it teleported again naked and being tossed.  
Purson: You are about to learn exactly how much you can live through  
I was screaming so loud and he was talking so low and I could still hear him it was like he was talking in my head, I was so mad at myself I really thought I was gonna end a contract with a demon and he not gonna find any loophole to get his lick back I's real dumb.

Purson: Who do you believe is coming to help you, which night in shining armor is going to rescue you, you aren't a princess you're a whore and I'm going to enjoy you the way whore's are supposed to be enjoyed I'm going to fuck you and bleed you and leave you in the field for the buzzards to have, because little bitch leaving you for dead is not the same as killing you.

I Was Preparing myself when I started to hear an argument outside and it was getting louder, if he didn't still have his hand over my mouth I'd be tempted to ask what the fuck was going on, but then he stopped and said.  
Purson: Looks like we'll have company

Amdusias: I Will not be bound so you can ease your wounded pride entering her would fuck us all, leaving her for dead is just as good as killing her   
Purson: She offers herself freely, she's a whore they don't have a preference.  
Alize: I wouldn't fuck you if you were the last creature alive on earth  
Purson: YOU\!\!

Alize: ain't no lesbo, so no pussyon, now thickness back there I desperately need him to beat my walls down  
Amdusias: No this was not a  
Purson: Your soul belongs in our realm anyway I'll see you soon enough bitch  
Alize: Come on thick Daddy help me stick it to the incel, by sticking it to me.

Eric: Zae, you ain't really fuck another demon no?  
Alize: No, he was a gentleman  
Eric: Oh god come here I'm so sorry  
Alize: It's ok I got something from it, I got my lil boutique, I Got my place I'm good

Mannnn did I let him fuck, demon dick is top tier, And this one was actually my type AsTa was cute and all but Amdusias was built like fucking Hercules and I love me a thick nigga Demon Daddy on deck.

. — . ..:.. .  
And that dick was thick too, I was in heaven, which was perfect since according to them I would never see that motherfucka, but like now I'm kind of super duper stressed cause that nigga filled me up then filled me up and I ain't never had no demon cum in me they be like they done but I ain't never seen no cum, this Nigga FILLED me the fuck up, and has been filling me up................I'm good, I'm good

Kimi: Demetri  
crying in the corner was all she did these days, well in the corner on the bed in the shower it was like some sick cosmic joke all the places she like to get get fucked Is now where she spent weeping over her lost loved ones but always calling out his name. 

Drew: have you asked her yet  
Demetri: and you are aware, instead I’ve been covering the tracks for a rouge demon who went wild and killed . innocents we had no connections to, so I’ve been kind of too busy to fuck  
Drew: oh buddy why didn’t you say anything, I have . walking grim passes I’ll cash in two for those deaths   
Demetri: you had those all along? 

Drew: Must have slipped my mind, but here, this’ll clear that all up  
Demetri: does it burn you up that you destroyed your chances by doing this and you can’t fuck her  
Drew: a little bit, but it’s real annoying her calling for you all the time so if you could please, please just go fuck her 

Kimi: Demetri…….I’m sorry   
he heard her, he was, contrary to popular belief not a monster which is why he hesitated to do what he knew was his only reason for being on this plane. 

Drew: you’re more of a hard ass than me I don’t think I could survive hearing her moan my name constantly like that and not jump out my skin.  
Demetri: I don’t know which is worse hearing you bitch and moan or hearing her cry and moan, but since it’ll stop you both.  
in that instance he was gone.  
Drew: finna fucking leee 

Kimi: Demetri   
Demetri: You know I’m always here for you right  
Kimi: I’m sorry  
Demetri: stop, you have nothing to be sorry for 

Kimi: I do I’m making myself a pest and I know how busy you get   
Demetri: it’s ok   
Kimi: it’s just sometimes when you aren’t around I feel so alone and I just want you to hold me 

Kimi: I’m being selfish I know  
Demetri: no, I’m being selfish I miss holding my little koko hime so much but I know you’re hurting so much right now   
Kimi: you miss me? 

Demetri: you really don’t know what you mean to me, not even the slightest hint of an idea do you   
Kimi: impossible   
Demetri: impossible for what exactly Kimiko 

Kimi: I’ve been back for a month now and this is the most you’ve held me but you expect me to believe that.  
He chuckled he never got to meet Kikyo but where did that lady go so terribly wrong.  
Demetri: so because I gave you a bereavement period and didn’t immediately bend you over my bend I don’t love you? 

Kimi: Demetri, you love me? Did you just say that Demetri I love you so much it’s hard to breathe sometimes, did you really just say you love me too  
Demetri: I do, it’s one of the reasons I wasted so much time here when I could have gone back home. 

Kimi: Will you stay with me until I get old lady wrinkles and die?  
Demetri: Will you give me a child? Or children and be mine forever   
Kimi: yes, please yes forever Demetri 

he knew it would be that easy, kissing her gently everywhere he made quick work of both of their clothes, he didn’t realize how much he missed  the taste and feel of her skin, he had to get some control or he was gonna come undone a little too soon.  
Kimi: I need you 

Demetri: So take all of me  
sliding completely in he had to steady himself, so his Kimi just went untouched this whole time, the thought gave him a possessive grip deep in his gut and he began a slow deep climb but the more she moaned for him the more she called his name the harder it got to hold on so he threw away control held her arms and fucked her hard and fast, watching her lose her mind under him he whispered.  
Demetri: Will you take my seed?  
Kimi: YAAAASSSS CUM FOR ME FILL ME UP I NEED IT PLEASE 

Reborn: Lucian  
Thalos: one second friend he’s   
Reborn: ohhh, should we turn around?  
Thalos: don’t be silly, have you never changed outside?  
Reborn: no 

Lucian: you must try it one day friend the cool air helps to cool down the heat of the changing flesh so nice.  
Thalos: my friend how long has it been  
Lucian: A year, the older I get the more I do not wish to be in the form of man 

Thalos: I heard you had some trouble  
Lucian: where would you here a thing like that  
Thalos: where are the girls   
Lucian: well here comes one right now. 

Dex : Hey dad, Thalos to what do we owe the pleasure?  
Thalos: I’m here to take you home  
Dex; I’m confused, I am home   
Thalos: your marital home, with your husband 

Dex: this is absolutely ridiculous why do I have to go all the way back he said we could just end it so like why   
Thalos: I would rather we do things the peaceful way  
Trinity: I bet you would  
Thalos: too many clans would be upset if I had to but if need be you will be handled little princess. 

Trinity: I’m not stupid I know what you’re packing, it’s are you fast enough to catch me before I catch you  
Reborn: are you really willing to start a blood bath on your land where one of your own could be a casualty.   
Dex: it’s ok Trin I’m fine I’ll be right back I’m ok, I’ll go just chill 

Eric: So what’s up munchkin why you all in a tizzy  
Alize: sooooooo I haven’t been able to see my friend Kimi since everything started with AsTa and like honestly apart of me low key felt like maybe I didn’t want to see her you know what I mean like 

Eric: No, I'm old and you're talking in circles  
Alize: No well, like my friend Kimi, it was her demon Bf's that's how I had met AsTa cause they like had this big ass Demon Orgy  
Eric: YOU WERE JUST A BABY  
Alize: let me live, I'm young  
Eric: THAT'S MY POINT WAY TOO YOUNG 

Eric: I used to change your diaper  
Alize: and now that same pussy be popping on a handstand  
Eric: you not too old for an ass-whooping little girl stop playing with me, now what about your friend?  
Alize: I'm just really worried about her because first I cut her off cause I thought maybe she was involved 

Eric: So what happened  
Alize: I just found out her Mother and Brother Died in a house fire but like it was weird because last I heard they didn't live together and then the house they were in get this belonged to Kimi like the fuck when did she buy a house and like again I don't know do I reach out to her like how do I go about it, what if she really did set me up. 

Eric: That Is so very, very much, but if this girl really meant that much to you and I can imagine her hurt, I would reach out to see if she's ok to test the waters because maybe one of the reasons you haven't heard from her is because she's dealing with this loss.  
Alize: Yeah, you're probably right  
Eric: I usually am 

Dex: Will so good to see you can you tell these .....................Gentlemen that you agreed after our formal separation I was free to go and this marriage would be disolved.  
Will: I did, you will be most happy to know I have found you a fitting, strong, Man that will give you all  you need and desire in a partner  
Dex: No thanks I'm good  
Will: I think not, your grievance was your loneliness and  I'm compencating  
Thalos: Brilliant 

Dex: No thank you, I already have someone   
Will: the boldness oh you to come into my home stinking of the undead parasite but to call it someone the sight of you is making me sick Dextra  
Dex: Beautiful I'd like to leave ur sight and never ever return, you are being difficult and I don't understand why.  
Thalos: Child you can have anyone else your husband has even chose you a new mate 

Dex: Fuck him and his new mate he can go fuck that guy, I'm supposed to go get married again to another nigga I'm not mated to so he too can potentially find his true love run off, and leave me as well?  
Will: You are being purposely negative about this so you can run off and be a filthy little fang banger and I really won't allow it, you have brought me more than enough shame. 

Dex: you don't know shame Will don't play with me I'm not your little mousey wife anymore  
Will: No you're my whore wife that got some dead dick so now you have all the mouth in the world  
Dex: You would know about dead dick  
Will: Mine works just fine, it didn't work for you because I guess it's just clairvoyant and it saw this in your future. 

Dex: Saw me happy and healthy properly loved and fucked  
Will: saw you proudly betraying your people to be a death dealers slut puppy, you had a million other Creatures you could have turned to you had to pick the one species we actively don't fuck with  
Dex: Ain't no we, I'm not French I fuck him just fine 

Will: And you're proud?  
Dex: Very  
Will: Proud to be fucking a Walking corpse  
Dex: like I said you are still the only dead dick I have ever encountered in my ENTIRE life  
Will: You are really testing me little girl, is this what whoring yourself out does, has you walking around like a vulgar little drudge won't be long before you're just a soulless Thrall cause you know that's all you are going to be souped up protection for when he sleeps in the day and he'll pay you with Dick at night. 

Dex: don't TOUCH ME\!\!\!  
She wanted to do that the minute he went back on his word the moment he took back what he said about setting her free, and hit her with this Racist bull shit, but pushing her was the last straw, fuck this, Trinity's not the only fighter and I'll be damned if I keep taking his shit. 

Will: Everyone out  
Thalos: Will maybe we should  
Will: No you brought this little bitch back into my home you made her my problem, out, or stay and watch at this point I don't give a fuck. 

Thalos: Right We'll check in tomorrow..............get some Ice for that  
He was barely Stopping himself from Transforming but he couldn't risk that, his beast would rip her to threads and that's not what he wanted, this spoiled little bitch needed a long overdue lesson, closing the distance he snatched her up and dragged her off screaming all the way. 

Dex: STOOPPP WHAT ARE YOU   
Will: Don't flatter yourself death hole, since you believe in hitting I'm gonna give you the ass whooping your father should have.  
And True to his words he didn't let up his massive hands covered her whole ass with every stinging slap and he didn't stop till she was red then he tossed her on the floor.  
Will: Get cleaned up and go to bed you aren't going anywhere 

Across Town waiting for her shift to end so she could run back home to kiss on her new baby, Elly wondered why she even fought to go back to work, she missed her little bean his tiny toes his wittle noes all the baby kisses, no idea of the chaos that just happened in her home, the magnitude of the madness.

Or the repercussions that she was about to face from a situation she played almost no part in, how the hours she was currently counting down, were about to feel like an eternity, she was just killing time looking at baby pictures when the voice behind her almost took her out of her skin.  
Ale: I hold no grudge against you, but you mean to him what she means to me so whatever he does to her I'll do to you but ten times worse.  
And then her world Went Black.

Silas: Brother you can't pretend we don't exist and then pop up with a, ah what is this  
Levon: A dog fish?  
Silas: Yes please explain I'm very, very confused  
Ale: She's a mermaid mated to a werewolf  
Levon: Gross they usually have better taste 

Ale: Her mate has taken mine  
Silas: Alejandro, that would be an act of war if he did that why would a werewolf do something so   
Ale: She's his wife  
Levon: I don't think I like our family reunions, is she a mermaid as well? 

Ale:.......  
Silas: What  
Ale: She's a Werewolf  
Levon: WHAT  
Silas: HOW THE SMELL ALONE  
Ale: She.....doesn't smell like dog 

Elly woke feeling heavy realizing she was bound and on a floor, she heard unfamiliar voices and tried to get a better look at her surroundings, what fresh hell was this?  
Silas: she really must be your mate, you're nose blind  
Ale: She is and I will have her back no matter what   
Levon: so it's an even exchange  
Ale: Yes 

Silas: oh look the Dogfish is up   
Levon: Hello Doggy style  
Ale: I won't lie this won't be pleasant for you, I would hope for your sake your Mate is not a stubborn man, because the longer he keeps what is mine the longer I do the same. 

Ale: Throw her in the cell for me, I've sent a messenger to her household and since that dog thinks he has any right to put his hands on what's mine, she needs to be whipped, and since my beloved was bruised I need her flesh to peel from the sting of the whip.  
Levon moved to Elly's side grabbing her not so gently and throwing her into the cell, he was really hoping this dog would be beyond stubborn he loved the taste of Mermaid. 

. — . ..:.. AM  
Getting to her feet, Elly didn't spend a minute thinking of herself, besides how easily they got to her, could they get to JJ so easily, would Jermaine be safe being with his father, would she get to see her baby again, she missed him terribly, and then confusion, they spoke about dissolving the marriage so why was she here as a punishment of him not doing so, so many questions her head was spinning but she didn't have the luxury of being able to close her eyes. 

Mallory: Hello you  
Jake: Hey, where's Gdawg  
Mallory: He's on a playdate   
Jake Could feel the tension as he walked into the house felt like he was walking deeper and deeper into a pit of quicksand. 

Mallory: Jake  
Jake: here we go  
Mallory: What  
Jake: Nothing just knew something was up and was waiting for the shoe to drop so you know what's up. 

Mallory: Nothing forget it  
Jake: don’t do that  
Mallory: nope forget it I’m not trying to ruin your mood so put the shoe back on nothing dropping  
Jake: don’t do that, please you know how I feel about communicating  
Mallory: that’s funny since I just had to find out through………. You that we could never have kids of our own. 

Jake: oh you think you cool drop a one liner try to walk off.  
Mallory: you laughing but I didn’t think it was funny, why didn’t you tell me  
Jake: when did we talk about having kids  
Mallory: that’s not the point 

Jake: It very much is the point not even when we knew we were becoming over night parents did we have the, so one day kids of our own convo.  
Mallory: I just always thought when the time was right you know and so much kept happening the time just never seemed right  
Jake: so you want to dump me now you know I’m sterile? 

Mallory: No, shut up, it was just a lot and I don’t know how to feel about it all.  
Jake: I always thought when the time came in-vitro would be the way, I’m gonna love what ever child you give me with all my heart 

Mallory: you scare me  
Jake: cause you always waiting for the next shoe to drop when you gonna get it, I like being barefoot  
Mallory couldn't help but laugh where did she get this corny old man from and how did she shut the factory down so they don't make anymore? 

Jake: I made you laugh you know the deal  
Mallory: NO, No, we weren't playing  
Jake: we are always playing now Anal or Oral  
Mallory: Oral, upstairs or  
Jake you kidding me the baby's not here I want it right here where the neighbors can see. 

Amdusias: Did you summon me you can't do that  
Alize: I, I missed you and It's been a while and   
Amdusias: Nooooooo that's a big no, we don't summon demons because I Can't come you'll get sucked into, what's wrong. 

Alize: I think I'm pregnant  
Amdusias: I think you are blind, can you not see? that you are clearly very pregnant  
Alize: I don't know, how I thought you guys had to ask permission to spawn with humans and all that bullshit  
Amdusias: Heavy hitters, world-enders, the most my spawn would do is take down a daycare or two and I've heard a tale of two human toddlers who can do that no demon blood 

Alize: Oh  
Amdusias: If you are that opposed to carrying for me though we could ease your worries  
Alize: No I just, I know, no I don't know, I don't know nothing right now  
Amdusias: Are you afraid?  
Alize: I'm so afraid, I'm having a baby for someone I'm not with which I've been running from this whole time, I didn't want to do this alone. 

Amdusias: So then be mine, no contract, just be mine  
Alize: Demons can do that?   
Amdusias: yes contracts are just easier for control because tempers like AsTaroth is having a temper tantrum right now he just killed Purson for failing to leave you for dead because my sill half brother was stupid enough to deal your life for some of AsTa's land.  
Alize: He won't come after you  
Amdusias: he has no ground, and it would be a fair fight no legions, I drag his skinny ass across the . realms, now come, i'd like to listen to my spawn.  
Alize: Can we call it something cute  
Amdusias: Ok come up with something, till then, it's my spawn. 

Will: Did you call her sisters for me  
Mike: yea, no one has seen her I don't understand  
Will: This doesn't make any sense   
Mike: maybe she heard your other wife is back  
Will: that's not fucking funny Mike, you know damn well that little hot-in-the-ass bitch is just here until Melvin comes down from the north Pack and takes her away.

Mike: OK but does Elly know that, maybe she heard something and took off  
Will: even if that was the case, she wouldn't have left JJ, left me, yeah I can see it, she gets fed up with my shit all the time but leave the baby, I don't think so, and whoever took her better hope she comes back to me without a strand out of place.  
Mike: If she comes back  
Will: You want tonight to be the night I see. Hurry up and get changed Thalos is waiting for us at the pub 

Will: Thalos why the fuck is there a Fucking blood sucker here, who cares can you rally a party together we need to find her as soon as possible  
Thalos: No need we now know who has her  
Will: I'll Kill  
Thalos: Stop,  my friend for now she is safe

Will: where is my wife   
Levon: Somewhere in your house crying about being held hostage against her will, wishing you would just divorce her  
Will: I'm in no mood for your fucking antics, you know what I mean.

Levon: I'm only here with A message from Prince Alejandro, return his mate, and apologize and you may have what is left of your mate everything you do and have done to his mate he plans to do to yours .. times over  
Will: You think I'm afraid of a little title I'll rip his fucking fangs out and feed them to him, he can have his whore back. 

Thalos: I think not my friend she's not yours to give anymore you've given her to Melvin and he'll be expecting his bride.  
Will: So he can go get her from the fang banger from her undead lord I'm done with this bitch and the bullshit that comes with her  
Thalos: it's not that easy my friend  
Will:the fuck it's not 

Thalos: Calm yourself   
Levon: Yes don't go changing little puppy  
Will: Can we kill this one   
Thalos: It appears your young lady didn't go after just any ole bloodsucker she got the official heir to the Royal line  
Will: I'm not listening to any more of this take her out of my house and return my MATE. 

Thalos: I told you it does not work that way, but she has been removed since it appears you cannot keep her safe  
Mike: Bro What I'm hearing is we need to handle this shit  
Thalos: I would suggest against rash actions that would lead to war or the downfall of the pack. 

Mike: Whose Pack, cause sitting around while they have my good sis locked up, doing nothing sounds like the downfall of my pack  
Will: Michael  
Mike: Yeah  
Will: Call Caleb and see if Jacob is near home, I'm gonna get my little mermaid 

Mike: Thats what the fuck I'm talking about  
Thalos: ARE YOU BOTH STUPID HE OBVIOUSLY JUST LEFT TO GO GIVE THAT MESSAGE TO ALEJANDRO, HOW DO YOU KNOW SHE'S NOT ALREADY DEAD, STOP FUCKING SMILING. GET OUT OF MY PUB NOW GET THE FUCK OUT NOW  
Mike: I'ma ask River if she'll watch JJ for us  
Will: she'd do that how nice  
Mike: Yeah she's been coming round, soon ya'll can meet.   
Ale: Again love this isn’t personal  
ELLY: fuck you  
he expected as much, her hatred was deserved but he would show no mercy he had waited lifetimes over and over again to meet his love and now that he had found her, he wouldn’t stop until she was in his arms again. 

This young one has no one but her selfish mate to blame, Ale made sure she was secure and then he began.  
Ale: I’m still sorry   
\*Elly screamed out so loud she felt the pitch cut her throat, you would think after some time her body would become numb to it but it was the same pain, she felt a liquid trickle down her legs and 

Ale: give her a dose of pure bliss for her sake I truly hope he does nothing else stupid while I’m away  
Levon: you’re leaving?  
Ale: matter has become……..  
Levon: out of hand the matter was always out of Hand of all things you would find yourself mated to a fucking dog, the neighbor has a poodle does that get you hot and bothered Alejandro  
Ale: Enough, I will go to this meeting and get back My heart, and we can be finished with this unpleasant business 

Melvin: Thalos, my friend  
Thalos: She is sedated in the room.........she bites so give her some time to adjust to the fact that this is life now and there is no other path for her, we have no way of knowing if she did let the Vampire spill seed inside of her so we will have to terminate if she becomes pregnant because we will have no way of knowing if the child is yours or his so I hope you understand.  
Melvin: I Understand we don't want the risk, I'm a bit disappointed, I'm very disappointed. 

Thalos: The Race traitor will come around, in time the fight will die from her eyes and you'll have a good subservient wife   
Melvin: I wanted a virgin, not a whore, and how old is she, I said someone closer to fresh blood, she also appears to have lost her maidenhead A long long time ago Thalos.  
Thalos: she is small in frame, with a small voice and big eyes she is very close to your type, now because your soon-to-be new wife decided she wanted to pull this stupid stunt I have business to attend to  
Melvin: ok, thanks I guess 

Lucian was walking the grounds of his land when his phone began to ring looking down he had to pause because he wasn't sure if he was seeing correctly, how, and when. answering his phone quickly before the call disconnected he prepared himself because he couldn't think of a single good reason she'd be calling him.  
Lucian: Hello Lucian speaking   
Zodiac: I'm Aware I wasn't trying to call the county Circus, just the local clown  
Lucian: To what do I owe the pleasure? 

Lucian: As matter of Fact whose body have you stolen you parasitic bitch  
Zodiac: Our Daughters  
Lucian: NO, you can't do that, won't that burn her up, your host always DIE\!\!\!  
Zodiac: Don't be a fool. She's my child, and one day, she will be me...............even stronger perhaps  
Lucian: A terrifying thought, but why are you here, why have you left your realm? 

Zodiac: You Don't even know the things that happen to you  
Lucian: What now?  
Zodiac: A meeting has been called, to determine the fate of your daughter and the Vampire Prince Alejandro  
Lucian: THAT'S WHO SHE WAS WITH?  
Zodiac: What did I find Attractive about you? 

Lucian: I stood a tall . foot . in my youth .. lbs of muscle and I still have an impressive   
Zodiac: She can't talk but our daughter can still hear everything  
Lucian: Oh, and she's really going to be ok after all of this?  
Zodiac: A lot of Changes are coming Lucian After my temple was destroyed and that great Masacare by that Demon a lot of my people have been scattered, I still protect the ones I can but it's time the Covens come back 

Lucian: Ahhhh shit, the witches are coming back?  
Zodiac: Yes, but first let's rescue your other child, where is her mother?  
Lucian: Don't you know all  
Zodiac: I don't claim to be omnipresent, I'm not a man I keep watch where I can on my loved ones  
Lucian: I...............I called her by your name once she packed up and left didn't even take the baby  
Zodiac: Men are stupid, goodbye. 

Lucian couldn't help but laugh in the face of all the terrible things, and things really couldn't be any more horrible, Zodiacs had been itching for a reason for bloodshed since they destroyed her people and the council denied her saying the demon was within his right it was during the few times they were allowed to come out and cause destruction she should have protected her worshippers better, she beat herself up for it so bad she burnt through the two host bodies she had in a matter of days instead of years, A full Royal Council meeting.................... Ahhhh shit, Dandy's gonna be there, he was already at the top of the wolf princesses shit list. 

Melvin: mmmm you're kind of big, he lied he said you were small, the breast isn't too big but the ass is too big.........I guess sometimes the ass comes in fast, so thats ok  
He spoke to the sleeping woman knowing she wouldn't respond, she couldn't respond, he had taken off as much of her clothes as he could before she began to stir, but she was still fast asleep, he would ask Thalos to give him a supply of the sedation medication for when she would become too much and he would need a break from her, she would do but he did have his preference, and he liked them................... small. 

He Had taken off his clothes so he wouldn't miss his moment to strike, he wasn't sure if it would wake her up, rubbing himself up and down her sleeping body was doing something for him though, he was a bit surprised he wasn't sure he'd even be able to get it up because she was so.................... big, but this was nice, she looked so innocent in her sleep, so beautiful so............................. young. 

He was wrong Thalos was good for finding him this one, for only Thalos knew of his cravings, he cleaned up for Thalos's misdeeds and in turn, Thalos kept silent for him, she was just right she had the look, maybe she could be a kind of cure for his affliction, his under-aged addiction, it was getting too hard to wait moving slow felt like torture but slowly he moved as he discarded the rest of her clothes he saw a small strip of adult hair, he would remove that later, but right now, right now he wanted to be in her, to spill his seed, even if it would be scraped out later. 

Melvin: Mmmm Sooooooo soft, didn't know the big ones still felt this nice  
She was starting to wiggle, he really hated that shit, but he was afraid if he struck her it would wake her up, and it felt too good to stop he should just shove it in her, she was his now, and he should fuck her good and proper so she could get used to her new Master, good wives should be obedient. 

Dex was so deep in sleep but she kept hearing Trin's voice "please wake up, please baby girl you aren't safe please get up please, run and swing, like we used to practice, I'm getting you help just hold on for me, I can't make out where you are but WAKE UP." Just then Dex Jumped up, confused naked and being violated.  
Melvin: SHhhhhhh it's ok  
Dex: WWHO THE FUCK ARE YOU?  
she jumped up to take off the drugs in her system making her unsteady, seeing this Melvin decided to give chase. 

Remembering what her sister said she turned and swung with all she had left in her, and it was a perfect rib connection.  
Dex: WHERE AM I? WHO ARE YOU? WHERE ARE MY FUCKING CLOTHES AND LAST HOW DO YOU WANT MY BIG SISTER TO KILL YOU?  
Melvin: Fuck, that bitch isn't killing anyone, you are now mine, the pack has gifted you to me  
Dex: Fuck the pack  
Melvin: We know that's how you feel you little traitorous bitch 

while Dex was inside taking justifiable vengeance on her would-be Assaultor an all too happy audience member left to go give an update on the situation, Alejandro my cousin you sure know how to pick them this one was a fighter but how long would she last, these mutts her own kind would rather give her to the type of filth they should rip apart than exile, which is what his clan would have done, reaching back to the others he related everything he saw to Silas and Levon, in Alejandro's Absence.  
Blake: So what should we do?  
Levon: The same thing, ten times worse. 

This was another pleasant dream, she could see how people could become addicted and abuse this drug, ever so often the real world would clip in but warped, and not for long, maybe she was hungry why she imagined being served food?  
Silas: has she finished eating the Bliss apple  
Levon: Why Even do her the kindness?  
Silas: Because she didn't wrong Alejandro, her mate did  
Levon: Whatever I haven't had Mermaid in awhile and I'm starving 

Levon: And she's finally lost that fucking dog smell  
Blake leaned in and took a long deep inhale.   
Blake: And she smells amazing  
Levon: don't they just, this is the perfume that drives men insane to willingly walk to watery graves forever  
Silas: That's why I won't be taking a smell 

Levon: You can't be serious  
Silas: Very, it's very possible Alejandro could be on his way home with his wine, I won't drink from a cup I'll forever crave knowing I'll have to give her up.  
Blake: Suit yourself  
\*with those words dipped his head and began to part her tender lips with his tongue, he moved gently at first, but when he was rewarded with her delicious nectar he drank greedily, fighting the temptation to draw her blood, for a vampiric cocktail all his own 

As they indulged in her flesh kissing and touching they watched how her body would react, this beautiful creature drunk on Bliss and pleasure, Levon long awaiting his chance shoved his cousin out of the way so he could taste the sweetest of drinks it was enough to make him finish and become hard again so sweet was she. Silas not as eager as his deranged brother and cousin to fondle the sleeping beauty decided he would satisfy another curiosity, what is going on in that little head of yours, what pleasant dreams have blissfully taken you away from the hell you currently reside? 

touching her temple he was transported to the most amusing sight, he couldn't stop himself he laughed deep and loud, I see this is how you would prefer things to be, ok well maybe it's better you stay behind your little safety net little fish, with the moans and groans I could have sworn your mind had taken you to a land far away maybe vacationing with your husband, getting romanced and all that good lovey-dovey stuff, you're kind of a hard ass aren't you. 

Levon: Are you sure he didn't fuck her  
Silas: What?  
Levon: I mean you left your post how are you sure he didn't fuck her  
Blake: When I left she was beating his ass, I went from wanting to help her to wanting to help him  
Silas: Levon NO  
Levon: I'll wait I know I'll get the chance  
Silas: You'll have to take that by yourself   
Blake: No I'll definitely join him when it's time 

The Enchanted door loudly announced Welcome Mammon Ruling Prince of the Demon Realms, Acting King in his father's Absence, we welcome you today.  
Demetri: Yes  
The last time he had to be at one of these fucking things it was his realm under fire because of that fucking Incubo thanks to a technicality it was brushed off and he didn't have to deal with much besides an Angry Father, and only now is he learning the full truth behind that whole ordeal. 

Our Grandest Welcome to Princess Dandy the Ninetails.  
Dandy: mmmm yes  
This was messy and she didn't doooo messy, so she hoped Lucian and his people knew she'd be paying them a visit after this whole little kangaroo court was finished this was the second time she had to be here because of that big fucking peace of horse shit man and now she's learning her daughters grown up to run off with a Vampire How perfect, probably the worse part about being here is that she would have to see............HER, I wonder what form she'll be in. 

WE WELCOME DARKASHA THE SHIFTING PRINCESS.

So it went, The Alien Queen, The King of the Seas, The Goddess Zodiac, The Fairy Princess, The Vampire Prince until all . Royal heads had arrived and one other who thought themselves a key person to be at such meetings a, vital role to make sure that the story was told.............correctly and the right kind of justice was dispatched, he knew which ones he could count as Allies and which would or even could pose a problem. lucky for him he had an ace in the hole that he believed could keep the powerhouse of the party in check. 

The room came to order and Ale made his stance in the middle.  
Ale: My true bride was taken from me under bias, while we had a treaty, she was stolen from me and punished for loving me, so I exercised my right to an accentuating exchange, EVERYTHING, he does to my Mate would be done to his with prejudice  
Dandy: Fair  
Thalos: you speak with bias princess let him finish. 

Demetri: I don't have a mate and I think you're going about this very diplomatically I have a pet and if anyone had taken her, I'd have to step on every treaty and truce I have, everyone would have to die and everything would have to burn, so you have the support of the Demons, return his bride.   
Ale: Thank you, I did not wish for war when I found love, but it is a love I'd fight till my dying breath for  
Thalos: Disgusting, how can you all listen to this. 

Alien Queen HighRosen: Why is he here Dandy, isn't your stand-in only needed when you cannot be here  
Dandy: He was requested to be an honored guest  
Thalos: Yes, sorry it displeases Your Majesty so, but I am indeed here to stay  
AQHR: There is nothing honorable about this despicable retch of a man 

Getting a little nervous about the turn of events and trying to find if he could shift the conversation to his favor, when it finally hit him, they planned this all along here we go.  
Thalos: Young prince when are you and this young lady going to give up the act, how long did you think you could hide the affair, do you think her husband couldn't smell your death on her, then you concocted this farse of a dissolved marriage  
Thalos: So that you  
Zodiac: ENOUGH\!\!\!\!\! 

Thalos: child, who do you think you are speaking to like this, why are you here, why is she here, why have you allowed this little devil spawn to be HERE, we already have the demon Prince why is this abomination needed?  
AQHR: how insolent  
Yuval: Thalos, I would be careful how you speak to the Goddess Zodiac, she's not known for her Mercy  
Thalos: Gah ga ga, what, oh my apologies I recognized the host and not the Being within Please I beg  
Yuval: You recognized her daughter and still spoke to her so?  
Thalos: NOO, this child is the child of a Demon, Prince Mamon, Princess Dandy tell him, please  
Demetri: you are Mistaken 

Thalos: No her father Lucian Had her with a Demon who would   
Yuval: Her Father was the Love Interest of the goddess Zodiac whose Temple was attacked by Demons, for the stupidest reason, some foolish demon thought that The witches in the Temple would give them super offspring because they saw Serefine, not Knowing she was the child of the goddess herself, and after the witches laughed him away, he destroyed a sacred hall  
Demetri: So we did the very least we could do to make things right. 

Yuval: More like Misinformed, you don't sit at the table with the trusted so you weren't trusted with this information  
Demetri: A simple bargain for the sins of one of my kind, hide the child of the goddess as one of our own  
Yuval: The Host is the future goddess so either way your disrespect is grave, but your very being is a disrespect against all that is right in this world you're a slime of a being Thalos 

Thalos: King or not I would not be spoken to in this way  
Trinity: I wish the fuck you would  
Yuval: Hey babe, where's your mom?  
Trinity: He got too close to you  
Yuval: So you sent a goddess Back to her Realm.............I'm scared  
Trinity: Don't be you know I only bite when you like it. 

Thalos: You think I fear you, I'll   
Grabbing his throat before he could reach in his pockets, Trinity crushed the bones in his neck.  
Trinity: Speaking as my mother's representative we need to end this meeting before more damage is done, while in spirit form Ale, I saw your brothers bickering about what is considered too far with the young mermaid, and two of the three men there are not keen on waiting for a cease-fire, So does anyone have an actual reason he cannot wed his Mate?  
The Room: NOO 

Trinity: My King let's go get your sister, Prince Alejandro, I believe You've got the exact location where Dextra is  
Ale: Yes  
Trinity: Take care of my baby sister for me,  
Ale: Please again give my apologies, to the young mermaid, it was not her  
Yuval: Keep your words, when I asses my sister, I'll see if I'm returning for war. 

Ale: If you could spea..........did she disappear while I was speaking to her  
Riri: she did, I love these council meetings they are so juicy, I'm so glad my momma let me take over for her  
Grim: Trinity was here, she's my number one supplier, and I see Thalos finally got what he had coming to him, he was my number one child supplier filthy Animal.  
Riri: Dandy, The Packs Got one hell of a shit show going on  
Dandy: It's Aunty Dandy to you little girl I don't give a damn how big you get, and yeah I Know 

Yuval: Ok she must be done I can see where to find my Lili  
Ale: same, I'm off to my bride  
Darkasha: This is the path you have chosen?  
Ale: and it is the path that has chosen me  
Darkasha: be well...........my............. 

. — . ..:.. .  
Dex was running blind in the dark around Melvin's house for what felt like hours, she couldn't pick up a familiar scent and she had no idea which way to turn, she was all but ready to give up when she felt herself being lifted, getting ready to give that man another beating she heard a voice she feared she really may never hear again, she started to tremble.  
Dex: Ale?  
Ale:Yes my love 

Dex: You found me  
Ale: Nothing was going to keep me from you, Mine, for always and forever  
Dex: Baby  
the tears started to flow, everything she suffered through seemed like so far past now that he was here with her, now that she could be with him.  
Dex: Lets run away 

Ale: We don't have to, I told the council you are my wife and I need you by my side at all times   
Dex: And just like that, it was ok?  
Ale: Yes, now lets go my love I need many children, so we have to start now  
Dex: How many's many? Can I renig? 

Who was she kidding, it was whatever he wanted, the kiss was a kiss of longing a kiss that translated to I missed you, I love you, never again, us forever, it took all his strength to part from her but he needed to get her to safety, these were still enemy lands, and he could no longer risk her safety, keeping her against his chest he held her tight and took off in the direction of his home, their home, the home they would soon raise a family. 

Laying on the other side of town Elly didn't have the bliss swaying her in different lands of fantasy, and Morphine was doing shit, all od a sudden she could feel the pain from her ass again and her body felt rocked as if it had drowned and pulled out seconds before she was fully under the big problem with that was SHE WAS A MERMAID\!\!\!\!\!  
dr: we aren't sure how she'll do coming down, we found a lot of bliss in her system, it's up to her to fight and wake up now 

Will: Ok so what the fuck can you do  
Yuval: I haven't forgiven you for causing this, don't attack the person here who is only trying to make sure she recovers and can see her baby again  
Will: Forgive me? I didn't do this  
Yuval: You may as well have, you let her return to work so soon after childbirth, you let her out of your sight during dangerous times, what kind of a man are you, you'll be lucky I don't take her home 

Will: I'm not doing this in front of her  
Yuval: You're right  
Yuval took his leave and Will, went to the bedside to talk to his sleeping wife, even if she couldn't hear he needed to tell her these things, he needed to get them out because he almost lost the chance to tell her, he pained at the thought.  
Will: Everyone is saying this is my fault  
He chuckled more to himself than anyone else. 

Will: You'd probably say it's my fault too, I'm sorry, I kind of feel Robbed, you know, them letting Trinity go and rescue you, but I think if I found you, the world would have to burn and I can't leave little JJ behind like that.  
He saw eye movement at the mention of their son's name.  
Will: He's really why you need to wake up, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing, Mike has had River over to help a bit and that's been a great help, I can't wait for you to meet this crazy bitch, she prays before she crosses the street babe 

Will: I NEeedD you, our son needs you, please, just wake up, I swear I'll never let anything like this happen to you ever again I promise I'll be by your side, you won't be able to take a shit in peace I'm gonna be so stuck on yo ass, just come back to us ok, plus if you don't Yuval is gonna kill me and Jj is gonna be an orphan and you don't want that either right? right?  
Will sat there talking to his beloved hoping she get so annoyed she'd wake up just to shut him up, anything would do right now he just wanted his baby.   
Trinity: hey I thought you headed back home already.  
Yuval: I’m going to head home to get my kingdom in order, I’m gonna spend some time surface side with my Elly belly, make sure she’s OK, and do some little investigation on things land side   
Trinity: ohhh cool, cool  
Yuval: So, I thought we were keeping things casual you know, sky and sea could never be, and all the other   
Trinity: YOU called me babe  
Yuval: You jumped in front of a bullet for me after flinging the strongest Immortal back to her realm, Dick ain't never been so hard so fast and I've seen you naked, why do you think I sat there for so long. 

Trinity: we can explain, it's a little act we used to catch Thalos off Guard, then you can say, it's not like we fucking and they'll hear the truth in your words and leave it alone.  
Yuval: You really like things as is  
Trin:.............I'm not sure If I'm ready to complicate things more like  
Yuval:am I a complication? 

Trin: Listen don't put words in my mouth Yuval, you know me more than almost anyone else and I've come closer to losing it with you than with any other man but You actually understand what's at stake here, and my fears   
Yuval: You think that's just gonna be your luck the first time you give it up boom pregnant  
Trinity: Yeah, I could see that, as a kind of you keep taking niggas out this world bitch bring one in, and honestly I don't know if I'm ready for that life, plus look at my role models ALL the ones before me are deadbeats, my mom left me, Dandy left Dex, AQHR don't know any of her kids, like I'm really not trying to join the line up of deadbeats on parade.  
Yuval: You are not going to be a deadbeat,  
Trin: I'm a gun-toting maniac, who likes murder and Mayhem   
Yuval: Stop selling yourself short, life already did that with your height, look I really have to run to get things in order, Meet me at my place by the sea in a month when I come back we can finish this talk I'm not going to push you into anything you don't want, but I am going to plead my case. 

Jackie: Where you going?  
Caleb: In hiding, you coming  
Jackie: Wait so if I didn't ask you wouldn't have taken me that's wild  
Caleb: the Canidae Princess is in the Mortal Realm and she's on the hunt and my entire pack is on her shit list 

Jackie: what did you do  
Caleb: Cheat on her Sister with a shifter then leave her sister, then mate and impregnated with said shifter  
Jackie: I'm sorry what the fuck did you say  
Caleb: So do you understand why we have to hide  
Jackie: You made me a side bitch? 

Caleb: Umm, no, I made you my mate, you started as  
Jackie: You aren't safe here either   
Caleb: Jacks wait, let me explain  
Jackie: Nope, don't explain, shit get the fuck out my house  
Caleb: Please look, you knnow we don't control when and where we find our mates 

Jackie: No but you control your fucking mouth, you did not tell me about any girl when we got together that firs time and I asked, I ASKED CALEB, you remember cause I remember clear as fucking day  
Caleb: wait cause  
Jackie: cause what, what am I waiting for, what have I misunderstood  
Caleb: when could I have, I didn't exactly plan, how things happened 

. — . .:. .  
Caleb: I came to the house to see Jake I ain't exactly plan what happened to happen  
Jackie: I'm so glad you remembered that ok since we having flashbacks, let's flash back, you came to see Jake, I said he had a long surgery the day before I don't think I'd be turning back for another couple of days or did you leave?

Caleb: You just got in  
Jackie: Yeah I Figured I'd take some time and unwind while Jake got himself some rest you know  
Caleb: Yeah, yeah  
Jackie: Can I help you my good sir  
Caleb: HUh?

Jackie: even with my back turned I know you staring kinda hard  
Caleb: I just don't know how all that ass manages to disappear when you shift  
Jackie: the same way you tuck that Giant wolf into that tiny man suit  
Caleb: You are absolutely right   
Jackie: we're both technically shifters 

And then you made conversation about everything under the sun, you just kept talking and kept me talking but every time I looked at you it looked like you were gonna jump out of your skin like you were so uncomfortable so I'm like ok maybe he's too polite and doesn't know how to say hey I have to go or I don't need to be here so I'm gonna go, so I decided I'm going to try and help make this a little less awkward. 

Jackie: Well like I said Jake's knocked and since he's a workaholic and I'm a workaholic I don't usually get down time so I'm using this time to live it up a bit  
Caleb: Letting Go?  
Jackie: Oh hell yeah I'm bout to call my good sis Mallory and we gonna hit the downtown district I just came to change cause I would have been wayyyy too hot in all this   
Caleb: .....????  
Jackie: Well Obviously I had on pants with the sweater before 

Caleb: Of course   
Jackie: Anyway if you don't mind my good friend, I'm gonna find a cute skirt, and a cute top and go see if I can't find me a cute Man who trying to bury his face between my thighs, preferably one with a thick tongue  
Caleb: Is that right  
Jackie: Yup  
then I tried to walk away and the next thing I knew.

Jackie: Caleb what you doing buddy  
Caleb: You don't have to go all the way downtown to find that, you got in-home service  
And I'm like ok he's fine but I don't know much about him because this is at the start of the separation process and Jake had already started separating our thoughts so I knew almost nothing about him, except now, he smelt good and from the feel in my mouth, his tongue really was thick.  
Jackie: Sir You cannot just pounce on a lady in her home like this it is not ok

Caleb: Better?  
Jackie: You something else  
Caleb: You smell good enough to eat and I'm a hungry man  
Jackie: down wolfie quick Q & A

Caleb: Yes Mam  
Jackie: Ok first and most important of all the questions do you have a girlfriend, bf, wife, husband, none gender conforming partner in your life, or some crazy person who thinks you belong to them, or someone you are sleeping with on the regular, or someone you give occasional dick to?  
And you're telling me now you fucking lied because you didn't give a convoluted answer to make me doubt or pause or even think maybe, you just said no straight up no, that was one of the quickest questions you answered that night before you got tired of my questions and flung me on the bed, which I would have never let happen if I had known you had someone, no matter how long it had been.

Caleb: I didn't lie, she was no longer anything to me once my beast claimed you, I don't even know how I lasted as long as I did with him screaming in my head that he needed to taste you, I could smell you, and it didn't help when you started to get wet, knowing you wanted me just as bad as I wanted you, it was too much, I'm surprised you didn't get pregnant that night.  
Jackie: Back to the point, you are getting off point

Caleb: Is the Point not that we were meant to be and nothing could stand in the way of that  
Jackie: The point is if you loved me, you would have loved me enough to tell me the truth and maybe we could have fucked i don't know AFTER you dumped the bitch but your dick made you lie and now I need you to get the fuck out my house  
Caleb: Jackie\!\! you can't  
Jackie: Ummmm yes the fuck I can this is my house and we are not legally married I'm not a werewolf so this mating is on your end so maybe you and your dick can explain yourself to your beast. GET OUT\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!

Trinity: Oh shit you clean up nice  
Yuval: You came, I'm glad  
Trinity: Who did ya braids they trying to take me too they look good  
Yuval: you like them a couple of the Oceanid's did them  
Trinity: Ooooh

Royal Secretary Pam: Sorry my lord, young lady the sovereign is not available for autographs  
Trinity: Oh but I really want one  
RS.Pam: none the less that can't be accommodated   
Trinity: Please Mr. Sovereign, please can you sign my titties, I bought them just for you.  
Yuval stood back and laughed at the antics before him, poor Pam, she's about to have a meltdown. 

RS.Pam: Young lady I suggest you see yourself off the property before I call security  
Yuval: Pam  
Rs.Pam: Your Majesty it's ok you have to be firm with these types the next thing you know you're wrapped up in some me too scandal about how you took advantage of her after she desperately threw herself at you  
Trinity: He wishes  
Rs.Pam: don't flatter yourself street walker our sovereign wouldn't cast you a second glance  
Trinity: Yuval, this lady, you gonna let this lady talk me back home, virginity intact  
Rs.Pam: Virginity HA 

Yuval: Pam, you'll apologize to princess Serefine and that'll be all for today  
Rs.Pam: Pri pri pri pri  
Trinity: oof, I heard her sanity shatter  
RS.Pam: I'll be excusing myself now

Yuval: Yeeah  
Trinity began to laugh so hard she fell off the lounge chair, Big Bad King OF THE WORLDS OCEANS oh my god, that must have been the worst, guess he was really the king of all things salty, trying to compose herself and pick herself up she found herself face to face with him and all of a sudden all the laughter stopped. 

Trinity: so let me guess, y'all thought I put that black magic on ya boy?  
Yuval: we did, but survey said, that was a lie, no trace of any sort of enchantment  
Trinity: Damn so what you do?

Yuval: Is that right  
Trinity: Mmmm  
Yuval: You ain't come here to give me something you been guarding harder than ya life  
Trinity: Sooooo  
Yuval: I don't want it, without the love 

turning her around, wrapping his arms around her hips he placed butterfly kisses on her neck, he was trying to be sensual without pushing himself over the edge, cause he was already ready but his buddy was gonna have to wait, the last three years showed him what he needed to do, now he had the almost impossible task of trying to Tame this wild ass Mare and try to come out in one Peace.  
Yuval: You don't miss being in my arms  
Trinity: Boy why you playing with me  
Yuval: Boy? 

Trinity: Wait, wait I misspoke   
Yuval: Nah, you said boy, I need to come correct, clearly I'm the reason you misspoke  
Trinity: Why are you doing this if you not bout to fuck me when i'm finally ready to get fucked  
Yuval: Cause. I want more  
Trinity: Whhhyyyyyy????? 

Yuval: You scared?  
Trinity: Yeah  
Yuval: You think I'm gonna hurt you  
Trinity: maybe  
Yuval: Have I ever hurt you before? In any way any form? 

Trinity: No  
Yuval: So what are you afraid of  
Trinity: I don't know, the unknown, what do you want, my love of course I love you, you are one of my favorite people, so what do you want, you want me to be your girlfriend? We technically went public so what now do you wanna make it official cause I opened my big mouth?  
Yuval: Kind of  
He let her go twirling her to face him but nothing could have prepared her for what she was faced with. 

Yuval: Serefine  
Trinity: ..........Whats that?  
Yuval: will you marry me?  
Trinity: that's not funny 

He had to hold in the laugh if he started laughing she'd never believe him at it would reverse his hard work.  
Yuval: I'm serious, worst three years of my life, I never want to live without you again, without your smile, your kisses, the evil laugh you do before you go on a hunt  
Trinity: Like, you're really serious right now?  
Yuval: Yeah  
Trinity: You want to marry me too? 

Yuval: Too?  
Trinity: Of course, I wanna marry you, but I thought we couldn't be together, Sky and Sea  
Yuval: The sea touches the sky more than it touches land, plus fuck old wives tales, if being together means the world ends, we were due for a restart anyway  
Trinity: Yes, yes Yessss Oh my god this ring is huge.  
Yuval: That's why I had to leave I had to go pick it up they just finished making it. 

Trinity: I'm losing my shit, I'm on a special type of high I feel like I just slaughtered a village of child rapist  
Yuval: Babe I'm a buy you a regular people thesaurus   
Trinity: but wait How would this I can't live underwater  
Yuval: No but You can live On the water I have an Island above my castle, I thought this through it'll be fine 

Jumping with glee into the arms of her love she couldn't stop smiling and the feeling was truly something else.  
Trinity: Ok wait so ummm, we gonna do the nasty now?  
Yuval: NOPE  
Trinity: What, why not I said yes  
Yuval: yeah now you can wait till you say I do  
Trinity: I do, I do I dooooooo  
Yuval: Ok Kell, we got orange soda in the fridge, Dick after the wedding   
This was the type of aggravation that had him ready to burn his own realm to the ground so everyone had been running around trying to be the one to fulfill a prophecy that they didn’t even understand, causing him problems and leaving behind mess for him to fix, fucking imbeciles, speaking of where was his personal in home imbecile. 

Demetri: Ah there you are  
Drew: how was the gathering  
Demetri: enlightening, do you remember the last gathering  
Drew: yes incubo slaughtered those witches who wouldn’t give him a child of power. 

Demetri: No you see you were even less informed than I, they couldn't care less about the Worshippers, they Cared about the Temple, and the only one who cared about her worshippers was the goddess........whose home was the temple.  
Drew: Wait what  
Demetri: The temple was the home of the goddess Zodiac, not the witches, Incubo only saw the witches in the temple because Zodiac has no Tangible form and needs a host to be more personal with her flock, the child incubo saw wasn't just any child it was the child of the goddess, who had taken a lover and became pregnant while in a host body. 

Drew: SO, everyone is running around trying to find any little piece of this temples bloodline so they could be the one to bring hell on earth all the while prophecy was saying we'd have to somehow convince this goddess to give up the goods but by Incubo going on his little temper tantrum he probably fucked those chances  
Demetri sat nodding, watching as realization and anger came over his old friend.  
Drew: And AsTaroth is about to make it worst  
Demetri: How so  
Drew: First the girl said no repeatedly to baring his child to the point she just ended her contract with him, enraged but unable to lash out himself because she didn't cross any lines, he decided he would try and loophole kill her using Purson, except Amdusias fearful of another bounding like what came after Incubo interceeded 

Drew: From what I hear, he's also seeded her AsTaroth in his anger killed Purson and has been desperate to find a way to seek vengeance for his wounded pride  
Demetri: Amdusias knows even if the rumors were true his child would not   
Drew: I think It's that silly thing that happens to you older Demons when eternity gets lonely and you start falling for mortals  
Demetri: A common occurrence huh, well, we have to do something about AsTa, we cannot afford for a demon to harm anymore of Zodiacs people  
Drew: I'll go look into that, you have company  
Kimi: Metri, can I steal you away? 

Demetri: you ok  
Kimi: ummmm I'm not sure as of yet it all depends on how you feel  
Demetri: about  
Kimi: Ok Look I swear to God, wait can I swear to him in front of you do that even work like that   
Demetri: It's all blasphemy but continue, you swear to your most disappointed father 

Kimi: that I was never with nobody else just you and thats it  
Demetri: I'm aware  
Kimi: well look at me  
Demetri: Delicious  
Kimi: No I mean look at me, look at me 

This game was too fun to stop, with all the nonsense going on in his realm he deserved a little fun.  
Demetri: Your hair matches your suit?  
Kimi: I'm pregnant  
Demetri: Well yes of course you permitted me to plant my seed, so now my child grows within you  
Kimi: wait just like that, I thought these things took a while 

Demetri: We are free to repeat the act as many times as you like, achieving the goal doesn't mean we have to stop the fun  
Kimi: But wait I'm like pregnant, pregnant, we just started sexing again two months ago, but I look like any day now  
Demetri: Demon seed, yes I feel like I did mention it was a demon seed if not let me be the first to inform you, Demon baby  
Kimi: Oh my god, I have to call Alize, I'm gonna be a mom  
Demetri: how nice you two can do this together.  
Kimi: wait what? 

Host: Your table  
River: Thanks  
Mike: thanks so much  
Host: Your waitress will be here shortly  
River: So update how's she doing? 

Mike: The doctor says she's looking good still a bit weak, she really liked that soup you sent for her  
River: OOh I'll make some more  
Mike: I tell her stories of the boys playing together and that helps, even saw her try to smile the other day  
River: Oh goddess is good bless her heart, How is your brother  
Mike: a wreck he won't leave her side, we had to drag him away for a hunt so he could breathe he almost wiped out the area's bear population, We've got loads of fresh meat now though.  
River: Oh my goodness 

River: Yes for the appetizer I'll have the lamb chops rare and for my entre, I'll take the steak Bleu........hmm, no sides  
Mike: Same, Babe you feeling ok? Also what's up with your sister  
River: Yeah I'm fine, I feel great, well she really was pregnant, and here is something I thought I'd never say, the demon is not such a bad guy he seems to really love her, the whole time in the delivery room he just held her it was so sweet.  
Mike: I'm sorry I wasn't there for Mikey 

River: It's ok I keep telling you stop beating yourself up  
Mike: It won't ever happen again I promise  
River: I’ll hold you to that  
Mike: make sure you do, I like being held too, you aren’t the only one  
River: shhhh Mike stopppp  
she blushed bright red, looking around to see if anyone in the almost empty restaurant heard him, she still hadn’t fully adjusted to all these new changes in her life the biggest one was being mated to Mike she appreciated how gentle he was the very first time but EVERYTIME after he was like a wild animal and she was obsessed. 

Ale: Asleep my love   
Dex: No  
Ale: what’s on your mind my queen speak and ease your heart  
Dex: how much trouble do you think I’ll get in if I go back and murder that fucking little pervert 

Ale: I don’t think any at all I heard your people are actually looking for him, turns out after your sister……… dispatched with Thalos  
Dex: murdered in cold blood copy  
Ale: well like  a metaphorical dam bursting, all the hidden files in his office secret bribes all types of monstrous things were found including a sickeningly large amount of evidence that showed that you’re attacker used to attack small girls 

Ale: The nightmares over come here, sleep  
Dex: My dreams are all nightmares these days and awake I’m living the dream.  
Ale: I can’t have you sick from exhaustion so here’s the deal, I’ll stay here and hold you and sing to you while you sleep so the bad dreams know they can’t get you because I’m always with you. 

Dex: I love you so much   
Ale: And I love you, not but once have I ever even come close to the level of love that I feel for you and it truly could not hold a candle to you   
Dex: I’ve never had anything even close to this 

Mallory was moving with malice, tunnel vision was guiding her way as she stomped through the streets A woman on a mission, she had temporarily gotten a pass to return to her planet for the day because she got news her parents were in dire need of assistance.

Taylor: I didn't even know about you the people brought him straight to me

Mallory: You think this is a game   
Nasir: Yes  
Mallory:Ok I bet you won't think it's a game if I 

She didn't get to finish, he pulled her into a strong embrace and a deep kiss, she wasn't sure why she did it but she kissed him back, maybe it was the alcohol, perhaps it was the fact that she and Jake hardly ever got intimate anymore, it could be that she was ovulating and starved for some physical contact but she leaned fully into that kiss and let her self enjoy it. 

Then That word slapped her and she jumped across the table it's one thing to slip it's another thing to slip during dangerous times.  
Mallory: I can't I'm with someone and he deserves better than that, that was wrong  
Nasir: Lucky him  
Mallory: I can't do that to him, he's a good man 

Nasir: Well Congratulations to you and your good man sorry  
Mallory: Ok bye  
Nasir: I'm going to need your address though  
Mallory: Why?  
Nassir: To get my son, like I said it's court papers I was coming to serve your parents with, I need my boy, do I need to go get the documents for you too  
Mallory: That won't be necessary, just give us some time and if you don't mind could you wear your glimmer, please 

Nasir: Not a problem  
Mallory: You not dead ass you gone full native, you even look like them  
Nasir: Is that not the point of the Glimmer, to blend in, how much time you gonna need?  
Mallory: Maybe a week, Jake has gotten really attached just gonna let him know, like his Dads alive and he wants to take him home to live with him  
Nasir: He's a man, men understand these things, boys belong with they fathers.

Yuval: I thought Celestials were closer to Angels how I get the one that wanna be a demon, you didn’t even know who is on the phone you don’t care who was on the phone what if it was my mother?   
Trinity paused and looked up questioning him with her eyes.  
Yuval: I mean it wasn’t but it could have been 

Trinity: Bastard  
Yuval: Wait.  
Too late, she didn't listen to whatever he was about to come up with she was just so determined to break him, she took him to the base, he was very close to imitating a dolphin, all of this because he was making her wait for marriage, he wouldn't break, he couldn't break, in the smallest voice he's ever heard leave his body.  
Yuval:I'm a king damnit 

Yuval: What the fuck  
Trinity: Oh my god babe that was cute  
she could barely breathe from laughing, Ole throatamus Maximus got him out here sounding like a bitch and now she's laughing at me, why am I not fucking the dog shit out of her again??????? No that's what she wants make her wait that's the real punishment, make her suffer out these next months till the wedding.  
Yuval: just you wait  
Trinity: I'm really trying not to  
Yuval: I swear when I finally  
Yuval: Talk yo shit daddy 

Yuval: So the person who called while you were unable to behave was my sister's worthless husband he said he had some news  
Trinity: oh my goodness did she wake up?  
Yuval: I don't know he asked me to meet him at the hospital  
Trinity: but did he sound hopeful  
Yuval: he did, he sounded like it was probably an improvement in her case 

Trinity: baby that's really wonderful  
Yuval: then we can get married  
Trinity: oh shit talking bout that I gotta call my sister   
Yuval: Dex? She good?  
Trinity: I need to tell her. she been in lala land with her True Mate I didn't want to interupt, ok you go check on Elly let me finally, actually call Dex. 

Dex: You're really real  
Ale: yes  
Dex: And you aren't going anywhere  
Ale: Ever, forever by your side, forever my love  
Dex: you mean it? 

Ale: I do, I'll do whatever I can within my power to give you whatever you want  
Dex: Really?  
Ale: Yes my Love  
Dex: anything?  
Ale: Yes  
Dex: I want a baby  
Ale: You would find the one thing I can't give you 

Dex: Why not  
Ale: I'm a long, long time past breeding age my love   
Dex: I missed out huh, wait do you have any kids?  
Ale: No, I came close once, but it wasn't meant to be   
Dex: Is that right, someone almost snatched you away from me 

Besides the fact that she was holding this conversation while rocking her wetness against him, he really had no desire to talk about Darkasha tonight so ripping her very thin negligee off and burying himself deep inside he decided he would show rather than tell his little one how much she meant to him. 

But what does it mean all day Alize's skin had felt very.......... off and everytime she checked the mirror it appeared lighter and lighter, Amdusias would no but he was away, and he said not to summon him........that it wasn't safe, but was glowing safe? It didn't feel safe, it went from irritating to hurting and now she was really afraid, was it the baby? Was the baby doing this? Is this just what Demon pregnancies are like? She had so many questions and no one to ask. 

Alize: I could call Kimi, maybe Demetri or Drew would know what's going on, How the fuck would I even, hey bitch been a min a demon knocked me up no not that one a new one, yeah so umm why am I glowing. like what the fuck, why wild shit always fucking happening to me I ain't even do nothing this time.  
She tried so hard not to start with the tears because she knew once they began flowing they just wouldn't stop, but she couldn't help it, she just felt so fucking helpless, she tried to keep smiling keep laughing but looking at her smile in the mirror only made the pain worse. 

. — ../../.... .:.. .  
Alize: Where's my win, when can I just stop, when I'm dead? is that what this is? I'ma die now? Ok I guess, I'm sick of this ghetto ass existence any fucking way  
Zodiac: Be still, you have truly suffered through so very, very much in your small life love, you were losing your baby, and I took the opportunity to use the child as a temporary host, this way you won't be hurt and I can talk to you  
Alize: Did I black? Out am I dreaming?  
Zodiac: No, now let us go to the home of your sister, I must speak with your siblings, it's time you all learn your history and who you really are. 

Mallory: Hey Jake you busy  
Jake: just a little lot a bit  
Mallory: could you stop for a second  
Jake: not really, can you talk and I work  
Mallory: Or you could give me your undivided attetion and see that it won't kill you 

Jake: Ok cranky pants what happened   
Mallory: you are still cleaning  
Jake: I'm finishing now  
Mallory: Ok so when you finish  
Jake: Is it your parents? did something bad happen with your dad? 

Mallory: what's wild to me is you know that's where I went you know that's a possibility yet you're still fucking cleaning  
Jake: So it wasn't your parents  
Mallory: You, ok I have to go  
Jake: wait, I'm sorry, it's that stupid time of the month thing old habits die hard and soI'm so used to deep cleaning and everything is driving me crazy I'm sorry babe what's up 

Mallory: while I was home, Glactin's father came to my parent's house looking for him  
Jake: His father?  
Mallory: Yeah, said he had been looking for him for a long time   
Jake: wait I thought they said  
Mallory: She told them me, but he's on the birth certificate he's the father and he wants his son back 

Jake: I mean, we can go to court we can fight it  
Mallory: You,,,,,,,,,you can't be serious, that's his dad  
Jake: He's been with us for so long he  
Mallory: He's not your son Jake and you can't steal people's kids that's not how these things work  
Jake: I don't know what I expected you to you've been dying to get rid of him I'd be surprised if you actually made sure that, that man was his real dad. 

Yuval felt silly to repeat the chant over an over but anything was worth a shot if it meant his Elly bells would open her eyes and sure enough, he heard Will take a deep breath and he saw his baby sister's eyes flutter open.  
Yuval: Ell's  
Will: babe  
she moved her head as much as she could.  
Will: It worked it fucking worked, baby, I'm so happy you're awake 

Jackie: I'm really happy you could make it  
Devon: What's family for, but I'm confused.  
Jackie: Hmmm  
Dev: We all thought you were the happily ever after family so what happened why he leave?  
Jacki: He didn't leave I put his ass out  
Dev: Ooop ok there's old Jack, Jackie 

Jackie: You are So Stupid I haven't heard that in forever  
Dev: More Nigga than the nigga you used to change into, how is Jake by the way  
Jackie: Doing good, family man, he told me he's about to propose to Mallory  
Dev: Oh shit, I love weddings, Hopefully, Darkasha will still be on messy bitch mode and I'll be able to jump realms without all the red tape bullshit we usually have to go through 

Jackie: Wait bitch spill tea what's up with queeny  
Dev: First of all, you acting like that is why people don't believe I like women  
Jackie: They just stupid, now come on, tell me, tell me, tell me  
Dev; ok remember she used to have a thing with the dark night   
Jackie: oooh yeah she was fucking Ale fine ass 

Dev: Ok well word on the street is the meeting they were just all here   
Jackie: Yeah I know about that, that's how I found out Caleb's scum  
Dev: You know what it was about?  
Jackie: No, do you?  
Dev: The wolf pack was holding on to his mate, that nigga finally found his soulmate and it wasn't her after how long she been waiting him to wise up and come back so they could just be together again 

Jackie: My nigga ain't nooooo way she was still waiting   
Devon looks at his cousin and sucks his teeth long and hard.  
Dev: You haven't been home, his birthday is practically a holiday, she set up around the palace to look how she knows he used to like it and get dressed up she prepares the whole month long, if you helping prepare you get paid leave your family get certain perks, all in the hopes that one day he'll come spend his birthday with her again like he used to 

Jacki: Hold on, oh shit thats work, again thank you, that's all that nigga was really good for anyway was watching the baby while I was at work so until I get a daycare you saving my ass  
Dev: Nigga that's familly I got you and your fridge stay full so I Got my belly tooooo, we gonna be alright.  
Jackie: You stupid, oh shit, and looks like I got some text too  
Dev: OH?  
Jackie: Mmhhmmm 

Jackie put on a mocking tone and did her best to imitate her Boyfriend.  
Jackie: "You can't be like this, you don't understand how much this hurts and what about my son did you think about him at all, you are being an irrational little bitch over a lie that was told almost two years ago, which has me thinking, are you hiding someone." mmmm ok mister wolfie sir   
Dev: Why they always do that shit, I fucked up, but it wasn't me it was you  
Jackie: I don't knnow, you the man you tell me

Jackie: You right, how come I haven't seen Devina since you been here, she mad at me?  
Dev: No sis studying for finals before we came she pulled all the all-nighters, she trying to pass this bar exam  
Jackie: I remember grad school days good luck to her, what about you?

Dev: Oh me and her gonna have to do what you and Jake did cause I just passed my flight exam so I'm trying to see if I can get a working pass for over here to start working for the airport because Etherwyn pays a million times better than Veilstone.  
Jackie: Facts, ok gotta go, the hospital doesn't really stay busy it's a fairly peaceful town, so I should be home on time, if not all the emergency numbers are on the fridge and I left an emergency $... in the first draw in the kitchen.  
Dev: An emergency........... I fucking hate rich people 

. — . ..:.. .  
Alize: Hey, so I'm glad everyone could make it  
River: I mean it is my house  
Alize: Explains why even though I explained what it's for you decided your puppy needed to present too  
River: AGAIN, my house, don't be disrespectful towards my fiance 

. — . .:. .  
Alize: I didn't come to fight River but it's OUR house, momma left it to all three of us and I didn't give away my share, so can you please stop being rude  
River:...............  
Alize: This is Aj, one of the reasons I thought it best for Mike to stay is because, like MIKEY, he's a half-breed  
River: Wait what  
Alize: His mom was a witch and his dad was a werewolf 

River: wait this happened before?  
Aj: oh no, I heard about ya'll my parents were fucking  
Mike: Heard about us  
Alize: AJ, is partially clairvoyant  
Aj: I'm sorry I didn't get enough information to stop the attack 

River: I'd prefer we not go down this road  
Aj: sorry  
River; Yeah you said that, can you please just begin Zae  
Alize: So I Spent the weekend learning about Zodiac and where our people came from and why I was losing my baby 

With A simple Hand movement Alize Filled the cauldron and lit the fire beneath it.  
Eric: Ok Hermione  
Alize: You stupid, I just learned how to do this, she said fire was the first element she gave to us, to keep us warm, to cook, for those with better control, for hunting and even healing 

River: This.......... she saying she created us, thats just  
Alizae: River you're fucking a werewolf ask him who his Creator is  
River: Don't be ridiculous different races but same creator  
Mike: Babe no, we were created by the Goddess Luna, she also wanted a form of man but one who could.  
River: No it's really only so much of this shit I can swallow. 

Mike: River  
River: No, the witchcraft was one thing but you want me to abandon my faith all together  
Mike: Baby  
River: I Don't want to hear it. 

Alize: That's too fucking bad sister dearest because I wasn't told to ease you into it, I was told that the children of Zodiac needed to be gathered and to be informed you holding so tight to the past because you're afraid of how fast your future is changing what about Mikey  
River: What does my son have to do with your nonsense  
Alize: Something is coming, another hit like what happened in the past except this time instead of just temple witches everyone is in danger 

Alize: You wanna protect Mikey, you have to learn to fight, you have to learn to heal, you have to learn who you are, before who you are hurts you, like it hurt me.  
River: How did you lose the baby Zae............were you partying  
Alize: Suck my fat fucking clit River you know for a fucking fact I haven't been partying in forever, so you just  
River: You right that wasn't the time or the place I'm sorry 

Alize:......... truth is, he was a demon, and because of what that one did all those centuries ago our blood can't mix at least not a temple witch, I don't know about any of the others but it was our coven that was violated by the demon  
Eric: It was the same demon  
Alize: Noooo not at all, but I guess it didn't matter  
Eric: You ok?  
Alize: Yeah.........I think so 

Aj: So about this big thing coming  
Alize: I don't know the baby was fading fast so I lost her but she said she would send her daughter to speak to us  
Aj: The goddess, is sending a Demi goddess.............Yeah I bet that's gonna go just great  
Eric: Do you know when? 

Alize: I'm sorry Eric do you wanna volunteer to be the next host  
Eric: Nope, I'm good you got it  
Alize: She kept dropping lessons in my head though, I figured we could practice before the little girl got here that way we could kinda be ready  
Aj: Little girl? 

Alize: Her daughter  
Aj: That cute you, think the million-year-old goddess has what a toddler  
Alize: No you had to hear her it's gotta be a little girl  
Eric: Probably a old ass woman like .oo years At the least  
Aj: cause the temple attack happened cause they saw the baby right and it's power, 

Eric: And that was like ... and some years ago  
AJ: Yeah so we expecting a grandma  
Alize: Oh shit that does make sense  
Eric: no matter how old you get you're always your mommy baby  
Aj: you know grandma's name?  
Alize: Serefine 

Will: Whats with the face big guy  
JJ: MOMMA  
Will: She'll be right back little man, mama's just on a walk  
JJ: Momma  
Will: I know buddy, but since mommy's awake now she needs some time to get back to herself 

JJ: Wan momma  
Will: I know papa, I do too, but I don't want either of us to see her siren form again so maybe it's best we just give her this time you know, we can have guy time, me and you, I can teach you...............................how to be and Alpha  
JJ:APA  
Will: Yeahhhhh Alpha, like daddy  
JJ: Momma  
Will: Noooooo like poppa 

JJ: mmm Momma  
Will: Sayy dada  
JJ: momma  
Will: Daddeee  
JJ: Mommy  
Will: There's a nice orphanage up the street you know, keep playing with me, you think you cute cause you're cute  
But Will was cut short by the sound of soft snoring in his arms, the little pup had lost the fight with the sandman and been taken out alright now to maneuver him into his crib without waking him up, that was the challenge. 

Gently placing his son in his crib his mind ran back to his mate, Luna knows what's going on with her head, she's been through more than he could imagine, first, he refused to let her out his sight but the rage she unleashed he'd never seen anything like it, then she just took off in the closest body of water, he was a wreck for hours until she returned then she returned and it was like a calm had come over her, she was different, mellow, relaxed He had held her so tight, but he knew if wanted to keep her from raging out it was probably safest he let her have her little swim, she always came back in a better more orgasmic mood, even the sex after her swims were better, so as painful and worrisome as it was to have her out of his sight it was better that she was getting her head clear and coming home happy.  
Will: One day daddies going to murder all the filthy vampires, after I catch that dishonorable pedophile. 

Melvin: I'm so lonely, why did Thalos even have a room like this I've never liked them this young, maybe I'm not the only one with my affliction, perhaps I have company out there somewhere, could be worth investigating.............no the point of a safe house was to stay safe, Thalos was gone now and that bitch got away, they're no doubt gonna come looking for me next.  
At first he thought he would have the pack to back him but then they found Thalos's office, where that double-crossing bastard held all his blackmail to keep him in line. 

Melvin: The Neighborhood is safe though  
He mused to himself, any little excuse for not spending another day within these four walls.  
Melvin: and all the families around here are human, I did see some of the local cool kids hanging by that little park behind the house, maybe I should go have a look-see, dangerous times we live in someone gotta keep an eye out on the kids 

Pairing out through the window facing the back of the house he saw several teens hanging together in the park, some really beautiful girls just perfect, the way that made his mouth water, some were a bit loud but he saw one she looked just the way he liked and she seemed so reserved.  
Melvin: Like a real little lady  
She just sat on her little swing and kicked and pushed the other kids hugged and kissed and parted ways, but his little doll stayed on the swing, moving faster than light he ran down the stairs, someone had to keep her company, poor little thing, she was probably still untouched, can't let just anyone have that. 

Nakira saw him appear, she had seen him speed around the corner and then compose himself as he walked over to her, but then, he just stopped, just at the corner of the swings, and watched her, this had to be an episode of punked cause real creeps or kidnappers of whatever the fuck he was supposed to be didn't just do shit like that did they, just stand and stare, maybe he had like a predatory kink and he wanted her to run he was trying to scare so she could run and he could give chase? Sorry buddy I don't scare that easy gotta go bark up another tree, and she kept on swinging without an acknowledging glance. 

He couldn't help himself he wanted to just watch but how could he, his little soon to be sweetheart was simply begging for him to approach her, don't you worry my love I'm here and I hear your silent pleas, I understand the unspoken and I answer, this isn't so hard, Thalos had always just brought them to him fresh and trained he's never had to do any hunting himself the thrill was refreshing tapped into parts of him that he lost touch with long ago, he hadn't been able to transform in ages maybe this little adventure could give him the rise he needed to reconnect with his inner wolf, my young dear your life has a purpose now. 

Melvin: Why hello do you mind if I swing with you  
Kira: I could have hit you, you jumped in my way  
Melvin: So sorry, don't worry for me, I'm fine  
Kira: I wasn't, I could have hurt my leg hitting you  
Melvin: Oh I would never hurt you my lovely 

Kira; Stop calling me endearments, it's weird I don't know you  
Melvin: My apologies it's of my culture to speak to beautiful young women in the utmost reverence   
Kira: You think I'm beautiful?  
Melvin: I don't think I know you are by far the fairest flower I've seen in this whole town, truly a vision that would have any goddess begrudging the face they could not call their own. 

Kira: You lying why you lie so much  
Melvin: Can I swing with you, sweet Angel  
Kira: It's a free country I don't this swing, or this park  
Melvin: Oh this is very nice, I see why you enjoy it so much  
Kira: I Like to clear my head when things get crazy 

Melvin: I bet they do get really crazy High School is a crazy time I remember the things I dealt with I wouldn't redo for all the money in the world  
Kira: When was that like a hundred years ago  
She was laughing, she thought him old, huh, he was a bit disappointed she wasn't as meek and mild as he originally thought but the body was delicious and he never did get to fuck that last little hell cat so this one would have to do, maybe hellcat was his thing now, he was the hellcat fucker, this little one just better pray he didn't get too riled up thinking about the last one and end up breaking her too soon, they had fun to be had. 

Melvin: That's funny, you're funny, what's your name  
Kira: Nakira  
Melvin: That's an equally beautiful name  
Kira: You say everything about me is beautiful, I don't believe you anymore  
Melvin: I could show you 

Kira: what, how?  
Melvin: come with me to my house  
Kira: I can't my moms expecting me soon  
Melvin: That's even better you know I won't do anything crazy I know someone will know you're missing, come with me I'll make you dinner, I'm an excellent chef, we can watch a movie and if you enjoy yourself we can make this a regular thing. 

Kira: You really serious  
Melvin: Nakira my Queen let me show you how you should be properly worshipped  
Kira: Will I be back home by . .  
Melvin: We can even do .:. if it'll keep Mommy off your back  
Kira........................ Ok I guess, you only live once right  
Melvin: Correct 

Nastier was tending his herbs unlike most dealers his weed plants were his babies he grew every strain and made sure he had full hands-on quality control, the coke, speed, bliss, and Drexel fluid he bought from outside sources but the weed plant that was his baby, herbology was one of his favorite things about this planet so he took this time seriously, SO WHY WAS A MOTHER FUCKER RINGING HHIS BELL RIGHT NOW, CAN'T BE A CLIENT THEM NIGGAS KNOW TO TEXT AT THE DOOR.  
Nastier: SO WHO THE FUCK IS RINGING MY BELL. 

Nastier: Ok  
Straightening up and changing into his, for human company disguise he got ready to go cus out the motherfucker who thought they were the police, or use his telepathy to reroute the police, cause he really aint have time for them niggas right now, it was almost time for his regular to roll up and he didn't want any trouble for them either, that was good money, and we don't hang good money out to dry.  
Nastier: Hold on motherfucker I'm coming  
He grumbled at the still-ringing bell. 

Nastier: Now nigga I just know it wasn't you blowing up my bell like that  
Nasier: I found my son  
Nastier: Oh shit where was she?  
Nasier: Jadium.................. she died, you not gonna believe this shit, she left my boy with Mallory  
Nastier: Oh, awkward, she said she was finna fuck you one last time huh 

Nasier: Yeah well, she might have fucked around and played matchmaker  
Nasti: Aint no fucking way  
Nas:yes, I kissed Mallory, and she kissed me back, full tongue, and she glowed  
Nasti: Get the fuck outta here  
Nas: Dead for real, I saw that pussy glow and she ran like a bat outta hell talking bout she got a nigga 

Taking the path she usually took Elly heard voices at the top of the stairs and laughter, one was Nastier but she didn't know the other one just her fucking luck, but she wasn't going back home without seeing him she couldn't she'd be no good, she was already back to zero percent social battery and she needed him, so she took her time and slowly went around the back, what kind of life was this she was living. 

Nasti: So what you finna do  
Nas: Thats why I'm here, I need your help  
Nasti: What you need I got you  
Nas: You got a house in Windcrest am I right? 

Nasti: Yeah it's a little . bedroom but it's nice  
Nas: That's where she lives, I need somewhere to stay while I re-enter my boys life  
Nasti: Nigga you don't even have to ask, that's my whole nephew of course you can use it  
Nas: Thanks man that really helps me out  
Nasti: Don't mention it, what are twins for, plus it's the least I could do after I took all the looks 

Tony: Hey Elly, the boss just stepped outside you didn't see him  
Elly: I came in the back  
Tony: I'm sure he'll be right back  
Elly: Uhuh  
Tony: You good? Are you hungry you want me to get you something to eat  
Elly: I'm good Antonio, I'm just waiting 

Nasti: Ok I have a prior engagement, I'll talk to you later  
Nas: Be gentle with her bro, she looks soft  
Nasti: I'm never gentle that's what the love  
The two brothers laughed as they parted ways and Nasti went inside to see what type of mood his guest was in. 

Walking in he tossed a bottle at her and she snatched it out of the air before quickly shoving the . pills within into her mouth, he watched her chewing ever so slowly the bliss exploding in her mouth and taking her where she needed to go, he didn't know what demons this one was running from but she was here once a week on the dot same time, same day, not a second after. And there was no use talking to her before she got her bliss break she probably rip your throat out. 

As she swallowed the last of it, he saw her sailing as he gathered ingredients for his late-night snack, questions were not his thing, your bag was your bag as long as when he helped you get out of your bag you had his money in the bag, but he wouldn't lie he was a little curious about this one, he'd seen all types, the rich the poor, the old the young, and almost all of them he could figure out this one her demons were new, he chuckled she better keep them motherfuckers in Shadowspire. 

Nasti: Doll face you staying to eat?  
Elly: No I gotta go home  
Nasti: Ok sweet cakes, you need a ride  
Elly: It's ok, I'll fly  
Nasti: AYO TONY GET YO ASS IN HERE 

And there she go, flying home, airplane noises and everything shit cracked him up every fucking time never got old, Tony would pull the car around and she'd fall asleep on the ride, by the time she got home, she'd be just right the bliss will have balanced out in her system and she'd get a cool week of the happys before her come down, enjoy it while it last sweet cakes, cause it won't last, it never does.  
Elly: Such a beautiful day  
Nasti: clear skies?  
Elly: Yeah 

Elly: No, no ,no,no,no not time yet  
It couldn't be time yet, but she could feel the real world creeping in, all the voices and the problems and maybe she could concentrate, push it out so she could get another day, she wanted to keep a handle on this thing it wasn't so bad as long as she remained in control, and she was in control so just push through, one more day, make the week and stay on top. 

Elly: That's right I got this, I don't know what I was even worried about I am the master of my mind and my Destinnnyyyy and I'm fine I Just  
WHY WAS THAT FUCKING BABY CRYING AGAIN.  
Elly: NOOOO, no,no, that's my heart  
The floodgates were about to break and on schedule, she would spend the whole day crying before she went back to see Nastier again,  
Elly: My baby is crying, I should go to him 

Elly: But I can't I'm not ready to be his mommy yet, how did this week fly by so fast?  
She tried and couldn't remember anything she did this past week just the come down filling her head with thoughts that would have her ready to go running back to Nasti begging for an early fix, not able to see how early of a fix, her mind crashing so hard she told herself it must be a week because it always took a week for her to come down, not realizing it had only been a day. 

Kira: Your house is really nice  
Melvin: I'm glad you like it, hopefully, you can spend a lot of time here  
Then suddenly the doorbell rang, his heart flew into his chest, who would, no one knew about this place, relax, no one knew about this place it was probably some traveling salesperson or some kid, just make quick get rid of them so you can enjoy her Melvin calm down.  
Melvin: One sec let me get that 

Dex: Heyyyy lil Bitch, you miss me  
The blood in his body ran ice cold, how could she be here, how did she find him, this place was unlisted, fuck it, He had the upper hand this time it seemed the dumb bitch was just stupid enough to come alone and he knew where the weapons were here.  
Melvin: Miss me Zombie fucker, want to make it with a real man  
Dex stepped past him into the house, he peaked out behind her, oh perfect she really was alone. 

Melvin: So you fuck them but you don't have the same etiquette, your not supposed to enter a home without being invited  
Silas: Very, common Misinformation, I go wherever the fuck I want it just helped your kind sleep better if they thought they had some type of defense.  
He couldn't turn around he didn't know when the others got in the house but he knew he was caught, now there was only one thing left to do. 

Melvin: I'm sorry, pleaase, please, please don't kill me  
Mike: Is this niggga begging?  
Melvin: I never wanted to hurt you but Thalos, he told me I had to do these things to you or else he would............  
Dex: Expose you for the disgusting piece of shit that you are? 

Melvin: It's not my fault I have an affliction  
Mike: Nigga what  
Melvin: I wouldn't expect you to understand, but I never hurt anyone...............on purpose, some were more fragile is all  
Dex: I can't stomach this  
Sarabi: Daddy, DADDY 

Melvin: You brought a baby? I'm not that sick  
Sarabi: Daddy why he cry  
Silas: Oh nah, Nakira was the bait, Sarabi is the executioner  
Melvin: Oh please, I know young Vampires don't get their powers until at least their teenage years  
Silas: This is the badman sugar 

Melvin: The fuck is this  
Silas: Half witch, they are born with it  
Melvin: Wait so please just hear me out, it wasn't something I could control  
Mike: You're lucky this the way they chose I wanted us to Rip you apart limb by limb  
Silas: Too fast. Slowly roast him pudding. 

The flames grew out of young Sarabi's body before jumping onto Melvin.  
Mike: She must be great for camping, I wonder if mine can do that  
Silas: You got a kid Mutt?  
Mike: Yeah I got a boy, half witch half werewolf 

Melvin: Make it stop, please I beg you forgive me, Dex, save me  
Dex: You got any food in this fridge?  
Sarabi: ooooohhh pretty  
Silas: Oh no baby don't touch come here 

Silas: come here daddy's big girl, you did so good 

picking her up to move her away from the screaming man on fire Silas took a step back to admire his baby girls handy work, more like a proud papa at school fair than watching the pedophile his baby lit up burn to ash. 

Sarabi: daddy him go wioossshh aaahhhhhh no please  
his ex wife was gonna fuck him up, he had to.  
Silas: this is our little secret ok babycakes we don’t have to tell anyone not even mommy  
Kira: are you teaching the baby to LIE\!\!\!\!\!\! 

Sarabi: I don’t lie daddy, lie bad I don’t tell lie  
Silas: lieing is when you say something that’s not the truth we aren’t saying anything at all ok?  
Sarabi: ok 

It somehow felt like this was it, this was really the end, he could no longer stand though he could see flames outside on his skin it felt like the fire was inside eating him inside out, he was so thirsty.  
Melvin:water please a little water 

Sarabi: I go get wata  
Silas: Make yourself a snack too honey, take your time  
Melvin: That's ok worse is coming  
Dragging in his last painful breath, he relinquished the fight, taking solace in the sleepless nights his last words would have on them and the horror that was about to enter their world. 

Mike: what the fuck he say?  
Silas: Some shit to try and stir shit up before his ass got fully cooked  
Mike: Yo how do you discipline a toddler that can do that  
Silas: Her mom bound her Magic, she really can't use it unless you intend to do her harm or you do other children harm 

Grim: Oh we have a full house you all watched this, who is this.....................................ooooohhh makes sense, why didn't anyone invite me I would have bought marshmallows.  
Dex: I Have to run I have to meet with Trin, tell Ale I'll be with him later  
Silas: Do you need me to come, will you two be safe?  
Grim: She's going to meet her own personal murder squadron...............ask if everyone else will be safe  
Dex: That's not nice Grim, she's not that bad  
Grim: I had to hire interns during the war she kept me so busy if the other side was popping out a clone army it wouldn't have taken so long 

Dex: Ok bye Ya'll  
Silas: You guys have one of those on your side I'm glad we renegotiated this truce  
Mike: She's on her own side, she has no wolf blood, and she's on more yours than ours since your king or whatever is now marrying Dex  
Silas: Oh shit  
Mike: But your other brother's life is still forfeit to my Brother  
Silas: Yeah, I don't know what Levon was thinking, matter a fact I do know his dumb ass don't listen and he got drunk off that mermaid 

Mike: She still.........different  
Silas: I have two daughters, it's only so far I could go, family honor be damned they are the family whose honor I want to keep  
Kira: Awwww Daddy you big softie I Love you too  
Silas: Ok think 'cause you got your fangs  now.  
in the midst of the talking death collected Melvin's soul, anytime anyone mentioned that girl he had to be ready for bloodshed, he wondered if this is what trauma is like, He's gonna have a talk with her mother. 

It was a week she made it that was the hardest, week of her life, why did it wear off so quickly, why did everything hurt without it, when Elly had realized only a day had passed since her last fix and she was experiencing her come down she almost destroyed the whole neighborhood, going through the motions without her happy was unbearable she found herself at Nasti's door so many times but she couldn't it wasn't time yet.  
Elly: Mmmm  
Nasti: You feeling better sweet cakes  
Elly: MMMhhhmmmmm 

She sat down at the table this one was really fucking interesting, he'd been watching her ass all week outside his house like he knew the long high wouldn't last he just didn't know when it would stop and he damn sure didn't see her fighting the way she did, not to get that next fix, at first he wondered if maybe it was the money she didn't have to get too many fixes, but she had little things here and there that screamed money, curiosity was eating him up, but he refused to break his rule, we don't do personal with clients. 

Nasti: sweet cakes. sweet cakes?  
Ok she was gone, he upped the bliss a bit for her this time so maybe she'd have a smoother ride, he had a soft spot for the little homie, sometimes when the Bliss was really sweet she'd make enough food to last him a week, just in his kitchen chefing it up, dreaming about god knows what.  
Nasti: Tony, get the car  
Get off the ride, wake up. 

get off the ride, Get Off The Ride, GET OFF THE RIDE ELLY WAKE THE FUCK UP. 

WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT, ok need to compose, maybe if I take it every two days not that would ease some of this, I could do it every two days then detox, and plunge my body into a cold flush there has to be a way to get on top of this thing again, can't afford to be an addict and as long as I have control I know I'm not an addict, could a junkie work out a scheduled fix plan NOO. 

:heheh: EllY: Look at me, Does this look like the face of a Junkie? I think the hell not I Look great, better than that, I Look like I've got an amazing handle on things  
Inner Elly: Funny how looks can be deceiving   
Not this again, she was beginning to hear that voice more frequently these days and it unnerved her.  
Elly: No, no, no I'm fine 

Inner: So fine you haven't heeaard the baby crying you haven't heard Will calling you?  
Elly: Wait what?  
Like ear plugs being pulled the sound of her screaming son came pouring into the small bathroom filling the space with the reminder of why she needed her fix, why she needed to escape, but it was too early. 

What kind of mother needed a fix to be around her own child, and she had these creeping feelings, long before the Vampires took her where she always loved him more when she was away from him, she enjoyed looking at his pictures more than holding him, it's one of the reasons she ran back to work so soon, oh god the thoughts again, ok maybe It's time to walk away from this for real, I can't afford for this to get any worse.  
Elly: Maybe I should call Yuval   
Nasti: What you cooking up?  
Elly: Some Kaava, ya'll ain't had nothing good to eat in the fridge and I thought you might get hungry  
Nasti: Your husband don't know, he's a real lucky man  
Elly: He's not my husband, matter fact he just got a divorce from his real wife...................................guess I'm just the glorified side bitch, they call it a mate in dog terms  
Nasti: Oh shit you got yourself a wolf 

okay so now he knows where part of her issues stemmed from. granted he didn't originally want to know but there it was she got herself a big bad Wolfie he didn't have many werewolf friends Bohemia what they were like when they were Junkies and that right there is not a pretty sight now the brain begins to wonder what did her big bad Wolfie do to her that had her run into me,  she must not have liked her  she must not have liked having her puppy brought up because she got silent after that and she work the rest of the time in silence. 

Nasti: Remember what I said, you take half now and half in two days, that'll help  
taking the first half of a pill and waited for the effects to set in, she wasn't running from her problems, she was just putting them on the back burner temporarily, but at least she could have another week in her happy place before she had to get to that point again, Nastier had told her next time to just knock but there wouldn't be a next time. 

Elly: AGAIN\!\!\!\!\!\!  
It was only a day, what the fuck is going on and that fucking crying, the crying she couldn't understand she just put him down someone was being loud and woke him up and.  
Elly: Just so fucking sick and tired of this household  
What was this, This was Angry, she'd been a lot of things before, sad, tired, weak, weary, Anger was new, she didn't like Anger. 

Elly: No, can't keep on like this what if JJ saw me like that, what would I say to him, he didn't ask to be here it's not his fault his mommy doesn't know how to feel about him, I have to talk to Will, I can't go on like this.  
so she got her clothes together to meet with her "Mate", she wasn't sure how this meeting would go but it needed to happen and it had to happen today. 

Will: Ok, I like this, what's this for  
Elly: I don't know if I'll get to do it again  
Will: what are you talking about?  
Elly: About how we are as we are so I wanted to hug you before you hate me 

Will: Don't be silly I could never hate you  
Elly: Are you sure?  
Will: Yes I'm sure, I don't think you could really do anything that would make my beast even let me frown at you.  
Elly: I don't envy you that slavery, when you first said you loved me and that your beast named me your mate I thought how beautifully magical it must be, for your heart to be so true to someone forever. 

Will: That's because it is, truly magical the way I feel when I see you  
Elly: is not how I feel when I see you  
Will: What?  
Elly: Maybe at first but not anymore, not for a while 

Will: What are you saying, why are you saying this?  
Elly: Because I have to, I have to get this all out in the open NOW  
Will: I'm really confused right now babe  
Elly: I need to go home to be with my family, I'm tired of being here of choking on air  
Will: What  
Elly: I'm going home 

Will: Babe, this is your home  
Elly: No this is your home, this is more Dex's home than mine cause at least she was a wife, I was just a glorified bed wench  
Will: Why would you say that  
Elly: What the truth? Why would I tell the truth it needed to be told 

Will: You have a lot going on still after your ordeal I get it  
Elly: OHH right my Ordeal, oh please, I had shit going on before they took me on my mini vacation I've been desperately trying to recreate since.  
Will: The fuck are you talking about  
Elly: I've been running off to buy drugs for the past couple of weeks, Bliss, to try and recreate the peace I had those days 

Will: You gotta be FUCKING KIDDING ME\!\!\!\!  
Elly: No, no I wish I was kidding you, I've been telling you before this baby came I was overwhelmed he came and the stress quadrupled sooooo I went back to work to get some peace cause I was losing my sanity in this house.  
Will: You been leaving every day to go do drugs  
EllY: I don't leave every, well this past week I did but I wasn't doing drugs 

Will: SO what the fuck were you doing?  
Elly: Getting away  
Will: So You're just going to abandon me and JJ and go running off to the sea  
Elly: No I'll take him, he'll be fine, he's young enough to  
Will: I THINK THE FUCK NOT 

Elly: First stop raising your voice at me  
Will: Stop saying stupid shit then  
Elly: ok big papa, bye enjoy single dad life  
Will: You gotta be fucking kidding me  
Elly: No you said I'm not taking YOUR son like you pushed him out so ok bet you and Vaporeon can live happily ever after. 

Will: Elly, please  
Elly: Nahhh big papa keep that same energy, you were coming in hot and heavy so keep that up, I've been screaming for help, for how long and you can't hear me so I'm done screaming at a wall, I hate it above the water, I'm going home.  
Will: This is your home though, what are you doing?  
Elly: Calling Yuval 

Will: So that's it, you're just walking away from your family, YOUR BABY everything  
Elly: Yes, because I refuse to lose me for everyone else, I'm going to get the help I need so I can be a better me  
Will: And you can't get it here or you don't want to get it here  
Elly: Both, you knew I was from the sea, you had me come to your fresh water home and my every suggestion to take our family to see mine was met with some drama you had to handle first well if you excuse me I have to go handle my drama first now. 

A Change came over the waters, he'd been plagued with worry the past couple of days but a calm touched the water and made it warm then a gentle wave, then another, something was coming. 

Yuval: Hey girl you felt that, wonder what's about to happen  
His dolphin pet just danced around him for a bit, before taking off beneath the blue.  
Yuval: let me go check on my bride-to-be and make sure she's all good cause for the life of me I can't figure out what it could be. 

Yuval: Is that my phone? You not gonna find anything  
Trinity: Yeah I know, but it kept going off it's Elly  
Yuval: What? What's going on?  
Trinity: She says she wants to go home, she wants to know if you can come get her  
Yuval: Yeah, Tell her I'm on my way  
Trinity: Don't forget your phone 

Ale: There you are you little minx, were you feeling restless? Had to go for a run? next time let me go with you  
The tiny red fox, shook it's head.  
Ale: NO, how not nice, come here 

Ale: Now You and I Both know I can grab you up before you think of running so you might as well  
the Tiny Kitsune Jumped into her true love's arms, it was always fun playing this little game with him, her fun version of the silent treatment. 

Ale: Oh I can never get over how small and fluffy you are, how do you fit that deliciously naughty body into this little cute ball of furr, are you licking me, you're not playing fair, will you change back already, so I can give you a kiss and a spanking 

Ale: Now you know my terrible secret I can never let you speak to another soul no one must know, it would be a sin and cause rebellion amongst my people if anyone were to ever find out that..................................  
Pretending to check for eavesdroppers or anyone who may hear him tell his not-so-secret, secret. 

Ale: I do love all the fluffy things, it's why I only eat humans I could never hurt a sweet defenseless little animal  
He carried Dex inside, she held her form until they reached the living room, then she transformed and exploded with laughter. 

Dex: This what you like Ale?  
Ale: You're a butt  
Dex: Let me lick you  
Ale: I could say the same to you honestly.  
Dex: Sir, I'm but an innocent little fluff 

The room was filled with the laughter of the two lovers.  
Ale: Innocent my ass  
Dex was laughing so hard her face hurt, but she couldn't stop the joy she was feeling in the moment made her head giddy and then she remembered why she went for that run. 

Dex: SoOoOoooooo we've been invited to a wedding  
Ale: Our own?  
Dex: Were you fixing to propose to me properly?  
Ale: As soon as your paperwork is finished with scooby doo  
She had to fight back another laughing fit and tried to cut it short, the memory of Ale imitating Will's confused face was too much.  
Dex: STOOOPPP for real Trinity, she just told me 

Ale: I've heard of flirting with danger but isn't marrying it a step too far  
Dex: No, that's not nice  
Ale: I'm sorry, who is the lucky guy  
Dex: Wild enough it's her old friends with benefits, I told her she was gonna end up with Yuval, but she ain't wanna hear it  
Ale: Sea King Yuval 

Dex: Yup I told her ass  
Ale: Your sister Princess Serefina of the stars daughter to the Zodiac is getting married to King Yuval Ruler of the seven seas master of the deep am I getting that right?  
Dex: Yeah  
Ale: How's that gonna work, I was shocked when I saw Scooby had a mermaid as far inland as he did, but I guess they made it work but how are these two gonna make it work 

Dex: LOve  
Ale: Cute  
Dex: She said He has an Island above where his castle resides in the middle of the ocean she would live there, it would be like her husband leaving to go to work every day.  
Ale: I guess that would work  
Dex: plus I heard opposites are in these day  
Ale: It seems we've started a trend. 

Ale: But I did need to talk to you  
Dex: Am I in trouble?  
Ale: Never, I'm more honor bound and I am trying to find a solution that works for everyone  
Dex: Whats up?  
Ale: So My brother and cousin have run off, for fear of backlash for what they tried to do to the king's sister, leaving behind a daughter and a son who now have no one  
Dex: Oh no what about the moms? 

Ale: Unfortunately not many can survive the birth, so much blood, it leads to a frenzy, Silas's ex-wife was the smartest no vampires allowed during her birth except him  
Dex: He didn't go crazy  
Ale: Oh he said it was a nightmare but not compared to the nightmarish thought of never having her again if he lost control  
Dex: Oh my god, that's so sweet, why did they split up  
Ale: Oh Vivian Is an absolute nut job, he couldn't keep up with her antics so a bit after Sarabi they went separate ways. 

Dex: I can't take you seriously  
Ale: But yeah, so Caspien and Belladonna now are kind of in the wind and I'm trying to find them somewhere to be, I don't believe these children should suffer for the sins of their fathers.  
Dex: They just left them behind  
Ale: Probably thinking it would be easier to get away without two small mouths. 

Dex: What if you can't find anyone?  
Ale: Then I would ask you how you felt about being a foster mother to a vampire and a Mermaid  
Dex: A what?  
Ale: Levon really, really loved mermaids  
Dex: Did she consent?  
Ale: Yeah, not to the dying, but to the child, she knew the risk 

Dex: I guess it's a good thing you past that time huh  
Alejandro: I WOULD NEVER,let anything happen to you  
Dex: OOhhh daddy, don't get me started I have to go meet Trinity  
Ale: She can wait a little, she's not getting married today right  
Dex:............True 

Trinity: no I'm telling you, babe, I've tried I really can't fuck with Dolphins, fuck them lil grapist  
Yuval: TRIN\!\!  
Trin: what'd I say?  
Yuval: you are about to be Queen of the seas, you can't be racist  
Trin: WOOOWWWWW, SO THEM LITTLE BASTARDS don't be graping? 

Yuval: some do, not all, every species got a shit branch  
Trin: thats crazy  
Yuval: you gotta not be a bigot  
Trin: I'M  A WHAT\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!  
Yuval:so what you just said wasn't dead wrong? 

Trin: weddings off  
Yuval: crazy  
Trin: why you wanna marry a bigot huh  
Yuval: she does this thing with her tongue that makes my soul just  
Trin: shut up, I gotta go  
Yuval: where?  
Trin: Dress shopping with Dex  
Yuval: oh so the wedding is still on? 

Alize was trying not to go into a panic, this was Day one at her new location and she was nervous, excited, scared, and thankful every emotion she could feel was fighting to surface, and she still had so much left to do, her life had taken off like a rocket, If you told her last year she'd have her own boutique and no more popping pussy to survive she'd laugh and say cute dream but she's a realist. 

But looking around at everything she had accomplished, funny enough without having to sell her soul was truly amazing, Praise the mother, kind of sucked finding out that she and her boyfriend would never be able to have a baby together, but...... adoptions a thing if they really wanted to go there, but did he really, whole Demon witch thing was a lot but that wasn't for today, today was for celebrating. 

Alize: Ok. Time to open the doors  
she opened the doors and the mini crowd outside pooled in she got so immediately taken up she didn't see them slip pass her, and walked straight into the dressing room, today was a grand day she couldn't imagine spiteful people today. 

Devina: Are you sure  
AsTa: Changing your mind, pathetic  
Devina: No I'm just, I'm new to the whole exhibitionist thing and the grand opening of a store seems like a lot to me  
Asta: It'll be fine trust me no one will know 

Focalor: Disgusting, how low some of us have fallen, I should go home, no pleasure on earth is worth working Retail  
Alize: Sesshomaru I need you over here  
Focalor: That's not my name, and you know that  
Alize: Look I'm sorry you still got that face on,and I be getting confused 

Focalor said nothing about what he could see behind the changing doors, As AsTaroth the Great had been reduced to doing petty things toward his once-upon-a-time fling, for his own self-justified reasons, he wondered, who was this show even for, she has no idea you're even here, then surprisingly a voice entered his mind.  
AsTa: It's for me, this little new witch just put all her energy, emotion, and power into this place, this building is a little magic fountain and I want to tap into it. 

It was bedtime and Jackie was laying Jamila down as gently as she could.  
Jackie: Mommy loves you, sweet baby, mommy loves you sooooo much, it doesn't matter if daddy wasn't here to see your first transformation, mommy can scream enough for the both of us, I'm so proud of you munchkin 

Dev: Wait a minute, is that, already?  
Jackie: Yeah he did his first shift today  
Dev: Awww, wait where you get all the girl clothes from  
Jackie: I went shopping immediately, you don't know how bad I wanted a girl, I burnt plastic today  
Dev: I believe it. 

Jackie: What about you  
Dev: Vina was awake, she was doing some shit  
Jackie: Oh?  
Dev: Some shit I don't approve of but I gotta mind my neck with that one she loves to tussle, talking about tussle she stole yo hairstyle  
Jackie: Crazy,, well I gotta go to bed so see whoever tomorrow.   
Liv: Ok but like soo if I'm a witch  
Eric: Which you are  
Liv: Which witch haha  
\*she cackled at her own little quip  
Eric: The kind that lost their way 

Liv: I mean the whole thing sounds kind sketchy, I was always told only the eldest in the family had power potential, we may get little sparks but nothing real  
Eric: Yeah it was a good control Tactic, they don't want too many Witches now do they, might draw attention  
Liv: What?  
Eric: The outside covens think that's what caused the demons to attack the temple of Zodiac 

Liv: My Grandma used to tell us about that story  
Eric; Really?  
Liv: Yeah, a bunch of witches got too high and mighty and called themselves Zodiacs chosen Coven and it drew the attention of a lot of demons, they claimed to be more powerful than the demons and they were all wiped out, by Zodiac  
Eric: How did your grandmother die  
Liv: .............she umm..........why do you ask?  
Eric: I can't see Zodiac letting anyone get away with blaming her for the murder of her children 

Liv: OH SHIT  
Eric: How'd she die?  
Liv: She was coming in from her garden she had a big harvest, and she slipped and landed face-down on one of her cucumbers. It went all the way down her throat she choked to death on the cucumber and her vomit, are you telling me that was Zodiac?  
Eric: Tell me how would you feel if some horrible monster snuck into your house into the night and murdered your children and someone said you did it because they were being naughty  
Liv: Wild as fuck but respectfully fuck that bitch she used to beat me every time I did anything that resembled magic 

Eric: so you believe  
Liv: Yeah, I guess, I thought you were just trying to fuck  
Eric: I am a gentleman  
Liv: I'm less a lady and more a tramp, I'm like now he hella fine he don't even gotta work this hard telling me I'm special too, so cute almost like we in High school 

Eric: No I Uh  
This nigga bout to lie, grabbing his face Olivia went for a testing kiss, he acting like she can't see his dick print smiling up at her, and she was kinda hoping for a little peak but she'd settle for this, look at him being all gentlemanly and sweet, ok she'd let him live this time with just a kiss but if that ass end up back at my house I need my cookies ate. 

Focused on his craft ahead of him it wasn't until the person was within the room he realized he wasn't alone but even before they spoke he realized who it was the question was why, why now?  
Ale: Why are you here?  
Darkasha: I wanted to see you  
Ale: Why?  
Darkasha: It's my birthday? 

Ale: Happy Birthday. Did you come all the way to my home on your birthday?  
Darkasha: You used to come to my home for your birthday, may I not visit you for yours?  
Ale: That was during our courtship, I'm mated to another and  
Darkasha: Ah that's right your little trouble making puppy, you always did have an affininty for fluffy things............................................................tell me  
Ale: No 

Darkasha: Would you have stayed if I turned into a Golden Retriever as well?  
Ale: I understand your hurt  
Darkasha: You understand my hurt oh my god ladies and gentlemen he understands my hurt and yet he's living happily ever after, I'm not living happily ever after, what was it Ale? Is it how I carry myself? Too traditional? I can change  
Ale: Kasa you don't have to do that, not for me, matter of fact not for anyone 

Kasa: But do you like this better? You called me Kasa  
Ale: You will always be special to me, but you were not the one for me, we tried, and I thought maybe I was wrong, you are a wonderful being but my Kasa you will understand when you find the one for you  
Kasa: Shifters don't mate  
Ale: NO, but everyone has a soulmate, and you'll find yours, I know it 

Kasa: I did, and for a time everything was perfect but I should have known he liked doggystyle a little too much.  
Ale: Isn't Dandy a close friend of yours how can you talk about her daughter in that way  
Kasa: aren't you .. years older than Dandy, fucking her daughter  
Ale: I Understand you're going through your grief  
Kasa: Fuck your understanding, you understand everything and nothing 

Kasa: Look you used to at least text me and check in to see if I was ok then that all just stopped, I'm guessing she won't allow you to keep me around  
Ale: Our last message was two years ago, long before I met Dextra, I was advised, maybe what I called friendship was actually just cruel, knowing how you felt, so I wrote you that letter and said goodbye to a good friend. 

Kasa: Please tell me, who gave me that advise  
Ale: What?  
Kasa: I just want to talk tell me, you didn't even ask me how I felt, you sent your letter and disappeared, only to pop back up Mated  
Ale: I'm attempting to disappear again  
Kasa:............... 

Ale: Sorry  
Kasa: Thats not funny  
Ale: I have a need to lighten the situation  
Kasa: does she know about our baby  
Ale:......................No I didn't think she needed to know about something like that and I don't lay around discussing you with her, that matter 

Kasa: NOW it was just a matter huh fuck you Ale, eat garlic and die  
Ale: When would it be appropriate for me to speak on a miscarriage my ex had with my future wife Kasa?  
Kasa: FUCK YOU AND YOUR FUTURE ALE  
Ale: I never wanted hate between us  
Kasa: We don't always get what we want Batboy, say hi to Bitch for me 

Ale: Life is not always so cruel, you will find your love, peace will come to you, I have to believe, you won't be so overcome by hate it darkens your heart, or even if, your hate for me is just so unbelievably strong, you keep your heart open for someone else.  
Kasa: Never again, Never again will I be left looking the fool 

Ale: I'm sorry"  
Kasa: Not yet  
She walked out the door, he didn't give a thought to her angry threat, only the hurt that he put her through, he should have let her go as soon as he knew she was not his mate but he enjoyed her company, and in holding on he hurt her, her anger was his burden to bear. 

Trinity: Bitch I’m tweaking cause not me in a wedding dress   
Dex: Awwww but you look so cute  
Trinity: do I? Ewww wait why are you still dressed go try on the bridesmaid gown I liked

Trinity: Nope but I'm bout to have some mermaid in me

They laughed until they drew attention and had to fight to stop.  
Trinity: Ok, it's getting late let's go, let me change.  
Dex: Can we get Food, I forget to eat sometimes I get so caught up with that man 

Trinity: So you ready to be a mommy

Trinity: IIght bet we out, you gonna love the wedding then open bar  
Dex: Is that wise?  
Trinity: All those hotheads and free nectar of course it is Nectar is the only thing that keeps them cool  
Dex: That's smart, I wonder what drunk Ale looks like  
Trinity: Ooohh about him, Mommy said something about being careful those he's hurt may try to hurt you, I don't know what she meant then the body she was in burnt up 

The two left out to find food and fun enjoying the day, a feat they hadn't been able to do in longer than they could remember, so much to come a wedding, a baby, and possibly kids, but those were tomorrows worries today was for corndogs and Jäger Logs.   
Lyxra: ... years of peace about to be disturbed huh? What could he possibly want  
Concentrating on her notes while mentally preparing for the soon-to-come intrusion, she wrote down her findings on the new sprouts in their little Garden bed, if her cousin had given her the decency of a call first she would have let him know she was busy, all also she wanted none of what he and her brother had going on but of course who believes in common curtesy anymore. 

Lyxra: Good morning Alejandro  
Ale: Good morning Lyx, how are you? It's been a while  
Lyxra: You didn't come here for pleasantries you didn't miss me, it would have been another seven.. years before I  saw you if you didn't need me so please cut out the long time don't see how's life been bullcrap and get to the point, why are you here in my home, disturbing my research?  
Ale: The years have made you hard my cousin 

Lyxra: No my family made me hard the years made me happy in my peace my family only showed up in time of need and not checking on me at any other point, come to any of my award ceremonies, my charities, but yet can always find me in your hour of need  
Ale: ........... I hadn't realized that was a common trend, I left you because that was your request I only now disturb your peace because I have no other choice, if I had known I was permitted to attend your celebrations of conquest I would have proudly been in attendance. 

Lyxra: You can be at the next one, any way whats up  
Ale: Your brother  
Lyxra: And you kidnapped a princess, I heard, how come he's still in trouble but youre good, he not far up enough on the royal bloodline?  
Ale: he and Levon were willing to, cross certain lines, his true misfortune was Yuval walking in as he was saying they could always just kill her and say that it was because the offender had  brought my mate close to death, if he didn't have a teleport stone I'm sure 

Lyxra: Garlic, sun exposure, decapitation mating ball?  
Ale: Gaahhhh that's your brother  
Lyxra: Ehhh, we can't pick em  
Ale: So he's in hiding I don't even know where, he's left his daughter behind  
Lyxra: He................he has a child  
Ale: You were unaware 

Lyxra: My brother saw me last year to see if he could get a supply of my plasma packs, he made no mention of a child or a child to be  
Ale: She's ..  
Lyxra: I hope Yuval catches him before the werewolves do  
Ale:......................?  
He gave her a slightly puzzled look, both options were gruesome to think of why the preference.  
Lyxra: Yuval has a dry drowning technique so on dry land your body goes through all it would sinking to the bottom of the ocean. 

Ale: Drown..........A vampire...........please tell me you're joking  
Lyxra: you're cute it's not traditional drowning, Yuval swells your skin and organs with all the water in the air and explodes them  
Ale: ........................... your brother  
Lyxra: had a child for Ten years and told me nothing  
Ale:..........................well yes 

Lyxra: I wonder if Yuval will let me watch  
Ale: You're serious   
He laughed waiting for her to say no.............hoping she would say no.........................the no never came.  
Lyxra: I'd bring the perfect snack I just Grew plasma berries  
Ale: Ok, so back to the matter at hand  
Lyxra: Ah yes, my brother's child 

Lyxra: Fuck it let me meet her who knows we may be great  
Ale: Maybe you could keep your feelings about your brother from his   
Lyxra: I'm not that heartless the poor girl just lost her daddy  
Ale: Thank you  
Lyxra: Plus I'm going to be sad too if they don't let me watch  
Ale: Oh dear 

here we go again this same fucking dream I'm so sick of this fake ass wet dream, it's the same shit every other night, he's telling me I'm beautiful, he's rubbing my thighs and kissing my neck, he says we can go slow, I tell him no I want him now and he fucking laughs. 

he makes me look at him and tells me some more bullshit, the worst part is, that I know what I'm wearing I love this set the crotch is cut out if I open my legs boom pussy wide open, but will I, nope. 

Look at this he laid me down and you thinking oh yeah I'ma get it right, he telling me all this nasty shit that I know Eric would never say, Dear Zodiac, why you torturing me like this, can I please just get some this chocolate man AT LEAST IN MY DREAM, I'm sorry my dead grandma pissed you off, but she dead you handled that. 

This shit feels so fucking real like it really feels like he's fingering me and it feels so fucking good, and he's biting me on his neck and calling me his Creme brulee and I'm bout ready to fucking bust, and every motherfucking night right as I'm ready to bust. 

Liv: This some bull shit, I'm over this witch shit, so now what I'm supposed to do handle this shit myself again, let me hold a make myself nut spell, this shit is ghetto and I hate it here, I just want some dick and to get a little teleportation is that too much to ask, I'm out here with half wet dreams and telepathy 

Liv: Now I see why Viv is crazy this shit makes you crazy all this time I just thought she was unhinged....................nah she was born coocoo but now I'm bout to join her, Zodiac if I ask my kids to call me Aunt Liv, just take me out the game 

Mallory: hey babe  
Jake: hey  
Mallory: What are you doing, job applications?  
Jake: no just some research  
Mallory: Ohh, on what? 

Jake: I thought I would have another look at the individual you gave our.............you gave the baby to  
Mallory: The hospital still has your position open did you know that  
Jake: I was not, hopefully, they'll fill it soon  
Mallory: You could fill it  
Jake: So did you know he has a twin? 

Mallory: Yes because we all grew up together  
Jake: Did you know your childhood friend and his twin were arrested on drug and gun charges?  
Mallory: No, my sister was fucking him not me, that's how he ended up the babies father  
Jake: ....................You think that makes him the better person?  
Mallory: Nigga what? 

Jake: Oh this is a very nice mugshot of him here  
Mallory: Why are you doing this what are you trying to prove?  
Jake: That it was stupid of you just to hand over the baby like   
Mallory like what Jake? Like what?should I have fought his father for him, his father who had been worried sick about him 

Jake: How do you know he was worried sick, because he said so you can't be that guliable  
Mallory: He's a drug lord acording to you right how would being tied down by a baby be beneficial to him huh? tell me  
Jake: Easy  
Mallory: Matter a fact save it nigga some of us are still employed 

Jake: Mallory, no come back here  
Mallory: No, you want to sit on your ass and do dumb shit cause you're in mourning the loss of a child THAT WAS NEVER YOURS, thats fine but I got lives to save, you remember what thats like, you turned your back on everything you believe in cause your paternal clock was ticking and instead of adopting you wanted us to steal a baby, I'm about over this shit  
Jake: I couldn't have said it better myself, I'm indeed over this shit  
Mallory: excuse me 

Jake: You're the only one allowed to voice your frustration I forgot, Continue  
Mallory: No need I'm done, I'm going to work  
Jake: Later  
Mallory: No I actually don't think so  
Jake: Mallory don't be childish 

Mallory: Being childish is sitting here arguing with you day in and day out over everything and nothing these days, I'm done playing house, I won't be back  
Jake: Yeah ok  
Mallory: Oh thats cute you don't believe me, welp bye bye  
Jake: I'll see you when you calm down babe 

Mallory: I'm going to make that an impossibility  
Well it was nice while it lasted, the dick the nigga, the town, the job, but she was ready to go now, she'd been homesick for a while but this really pushed her out the door, it was time to go, goodbye Jake, have the life you deserve, she was gonna mis Jackie, but this needed a clean break with no way back, he had demons he didn't want to leave and she wasn't going to spend the rest of her life fighting them.   
Trinity: Two more days  
Yuval: Yup  
Trinity: You ready  
Yuval: More ready than I've been for anything else in my life  
Trinity: so why don't we have a little pre-wedding celebration eh? 

Yuval: here she goes again  
Trinity: Where? where did she go? Cause I'm right here  
Yuval: Woman..................Do you have a bet? you got a bet with someone you trying to win?  
Trin: A what?  
Yuval: A bet  
putting on his very best impression of what he could only assume she would sound like talking to a group of her friends. 

Yuval: I bet I can get him to break, fuck a wedding he gone give me some dick  
Trin: First off, no I do not have a bet you know I just have a problem with Rules and Authority, and second I do not sound like that big head  
Yuval: Two more days  
Trinity: Is really too damn long 

Yuval: You telling me, I'm the one with a damn succubus walking around my home half-naked, rubbing on me kissing on me, this morning after that stunt you pulled last night I half expected my dick to pack up and move  
Trinity: You didn't fold though  
Yuval: What kind of king would I be if I did  
Trinity: Maybe you just don't want me 

Yuval: You know damn well that's a lie  
Trinity: Oh is it  
Yuval: I had to get armor for my Pants so I'm not walking down the Aisle with a hard-on  
Trinity: other ways we could fix that..........I feel him right now  
Yuval: I bet you do, thanks to you he's rarely not awake 

Trinity: You could just sli..mmm  
He didn't let her finish, he couldn't the words themself could have been his undoing, he had to relieve some pent-up energy, so he decided he wasn't going to suffer alone licking and kissing all along her collarbone had her pressed up against him just right, he continued to trail kisses down the valley between her breast. 

His little princess thought she was slick, opening her legs around him, even with all the heat from the hot tub he swore he could feel her fire within.  
Trin: My King  
Oh she fighting dirty tonight, He hadn't done this since he was a guppy in high school but it was time to pull out an old trick, pulling her down onto him so she could feel him through their swimsuits he began to rock his hips, her moans into his lips told him she was enjoying the feeling as well, she snaked her hand down to try and pull him out of his trunks and into her, but he removed that hand quick enough. 

Trin: Sir......... are you dry humping me? Rather than just fucking me  
Yuval: How can it be dry...............We're in a hot tub  
Trin: Weddings off, I can't marry you, you're a pain in my ass  
Yuval: I mean not yet, but once we get married I will be  
Trin: bold of you to assume I like Anal  
Yuval: Bold, Brazen, I'm all that. 

Mallory: I just need a break from this rock, I need to go home and clear my head, what the fuck is going on why it took me so long to get a traveling pass though..............who cares not my problem  
She felt like a runaway, would anyone else see she was running away, this one was a bit too much and maybe they did move too fast, even more of a reason why she needed to get away and clear her head, he was beyond a space of talking to and she was over the hissy fits because Mister mom was going through empty nest syndrome. 

Mallory: I miss my parents anyway it's been too long since I spent real time back it's usually a pop in and out and I'm gone forever.  
Her dad was going to be beyond pleased, he never liked Jake, her mom, not so much, she was getting real sick and tired of waiting for Mallory to give her a grandchild, it didn't matter that Jadi had left her a perfectly good grandson. 

Mallory: Home Sweet Home  
felt anything but, after the trip, the feelings of running away were all but drowning her and it was a lot harder to fight back the tears that made no sense, "why should I cry?" was the unanswered question she kept asking herself, but she was afraid answering it would burst the flood gates she was so desperately holding closed. 

Lovelie: Augustin, she's here  
getting up off the couch and grumbling as he slowly shuffled upstairs the older gentleman went to open the upstairs to let his eldest daughter in, just what he needed, game season being right around the corner, his wife who thinks she can be a mermaid and his Daughter and her little human boy toy, "she better had not brought that boy to my house." He thought to himself. 

Lovelie: Fix your face you grumpy old man, we already lost one, you don't want the other one to decide to abandon us in our old age  
Those words didn't just sting, they weighed heavy on his heart, he tried so desperately not to think of his younger daughter throwing away her life instead of turning to them for help, he didn't like the boy, but he loved his baby girl so for her he would play nice. 

Augus: Yeah, yeah, I'm just tired, they never stay long anyway   
making his way up the stairs, his little Jadi stayed on his mind what could he have done to save her, why did she think that damnation was her only salvation? 

Elly: I don't look too bad  
She didn't know what she looked like, all she was thinking was why did just a little bit of bliss sound real good right now, but why? The baby was with it's dad the dad was with it's baby.  
Elly: And I'm free, to be me 

Elly: spent a couple of days at home with mommy, Now I'm waiting for Yuvals big wedding, Gag, still can't believe that's a thing, and it's like I can't get away from that family now it's marrying into mine..............I mean at least they're getting married.  
And true to the matter she couldn't hate Trinity, she wanted to but the bitch was so damn nice and that night they hung out on the beach, Elly had mentioned how the sky seemed so empty and the bitch summoned stars, if she was a nigga, that would be a smooth heres some pussy move. 

still, it was such a hard thought. Yuval getting married before her, he didn't even want to get married, now he's getting his happy ever after, and she was hiding from her ...................Ex? I guess and small child, while fighting to stay away from her dealer, the open air and sea helped so much but was it a permanent fix? Or a temporary distraction to the larger problem 

. — . ..:.. AM  
River: MMM Mike  
Mike: You cumming baby  
River: Yeah  
Mike: Cum for daddy 

Like a magic trick ending she snapped right out of it.  
River: Stop  
Mike: What's wrong  
River:.........I just, I can't keep this up anymore  
Mike: What?  
feeling more confused than ever, still easing off to find out what was wrong. 

Mike: Baby whats going on?  
River: I don't want to do this anymore, I don't like how I feel after   
Mike: How do you feel?  
River: Like a whore, like I'm just living in sin 

River: One child out of wedlock ok circumstances ok, yeah, sure but, we just keep on giving into the desires of the flesh and I don't think you have any desires in making an honest woman out of me  
Mike: You're my mate  
River: not your wife 

Mike: Baby, if you wanted to get married why didn't you say so  
River: that's not usually how these things work  
Mike: Sorry, cultural differences, for me, once you took my mating mark you became more than a wife, you became the very air that I breathe, but if you would like a ceremony, I would also be honored if you would marry me, be mine in every way  
River: Oh Mike, that's great, 'cause I'm pregnant.   
Trinity: Hey you good?  
Elly: Yeah, just looking at the dolphins arguing  
Trinity: You can see them from here  
Elly: Sure can, I Can hear them too  
Trin: Woah 

Elly: so what's up  
Trinity: Nothing I just was making my rounds and telling everyone thank you, and I wanted to tell you thank you for being apart of this even with everything you got going on  
Elly: What do you mean by everything I got going on?  
Trin: With Will and all that 

Elly: Oh, Oh yeah, no course, it's not every day my big brother finds the girl of his dreams, I wouldn't miss it for the world  
Trini: The girl of his nightmares more like  
ELly: whatever, I see you with him, you soft, what he do to that cold-blooded killer  
Trin: What you mean, I'm a stone-cold, mannnnnn I'm hard  
This is why Elly enjoyed her, this girl could really get her out of her head and make her laugh. 

Elly: COme here  
Trin: Awww what is this for  
Elly: For being you, and for taking care of my brother. 

Elly: Don't fuck this up jughead  
Yuval: Language  
EllY : sorry sugar  
Celeste: It's ok My daddy used to say all the Bad words I know them all  
Trin: I forget they just little walking truth bombs 

Riri: How long is she with you? Dex: She’s actually leaving after the wedding she’s going to live with an aunt.  
Trin: Awwwww she’s such a sweetie though at least she gonna be in the wedding with us  
Dex: How longs the honeymoon  
Trin: A week  
Dex: OOOOoooohhh ok, come here real quick 

Trin: Whats up?  
Dex: So ummm about this baby thing  
Trin: You ready?  
Dex: Yeah I think so, I mean we talked and I've already been married I can wait on that part I'm ready to start our family  
Trin: ok, soon as I get back, come to the Lab and we'll get started. 

Dex: That's it?  
Trin: Yeah, what else you want? some hocus pocus  
Dex: Are you not the goddess of witchcraft and Magic?  
Trin: Not yet, That's mommies bag, I like to find out how to do it with science  
Dex: Is she coming to the wedding by the way? 

Trin: Supposed to be, they all are but you know how it is with them  
Dex: Oh you mean show up and actually be a mom? where do they do that at?  
Trin: support my child woah budddyyyyy I'm a goddess we don't have time for those things  
Dex: Not a thing doesn't happen  
The two began to laugh, jokes now therapy later was the motto, except later never came so they just kept on laughing. 

Dex: I'm so fucking happy for you, you have no idea, marrying someone you love   
Trin: I mean you got that now too  
Dex: I know but I'm just happy you don't gotta suffer the first time around like I did  
Trin: I"m just ready to get some dick 

Dex: Bitch shut up, you afraid of needles you gonna die ya first time  
Trin: Whatever you mad pussy, and if you can do it, I can do it  
Dex: You gonna be like "ohh yuval take it out it hurts oh no, now I gotta kill my husband"  
Trin: Shut up, you not funny, what you trying to scare me? 

Hugging her big baby sister Trin couldn't think of anyone else she'd rather by her side as she took this giant leap in life, her number one homie had been through so much now look at them, happy in love and doing grown shit like getting married and having babies.  
Trin: You better not be a deadbeat like Dandy  
Dex: I'm only a Demi-goddess, my babies safe, you the pure breed  
Dex was laughing but a giant lump started to form in her sister's throat, "oh god, what if I'm making a huge mistake." 

Lucian: To what do I owe the honor boys  
Lyall: Cut the pleasantries, Lucian  
Rhydian: Nonsense we can afford to be pleasant   
Lyall: You say that but just wait till Talon catches up  
Rhydian: Yes  
Lucian: What exactly is this all about, when since do your fathers send you lot on erands. 

Rhy: This isn't an errand visit  
Lyall: And we answer to no one  
Alaric: Can you two be still, so what they are trying to say is the remaining council has stepped down, we are the new council, and all the eldest sons have been called to serve.  
Lucian: So I'm on diaper duty because your fathers got Tired?  
Rhy: Well that wasn't very nice 

Talon: Pardon my lateness, I had to calm my beast before we could come here again  
Out of the group Talon May not Have been the tallest or Biggest, but he had a strength and a rage that left him mostly unmatched, and right now he desperately tried to keep that rage in check.  
Lyall: That's fine you haven't missed anything we're just about to tell him he has to step down  
Lucian: Excuse Me, young man  
Alaric: Yes that's actually what we're here for, by our old rules you cannot be a sitting council member.  
Lyall: Your Line has no future 

Lucian: I do believe you are incorrect, we stopped not counting girls a long, long time ago and it's a bit barbaric to try and bring that back, since none of us would be here without a woman and our reigning Goddess is a woman, you boys should be careful.  
Lyall: No one said girls are useless, we said yours were  
Rhy: You gotta chill Man, still gotta remember who they are  
Alaric: Again, your line Has two women one who is of half-blood who now engages with our Genetic Enemy, and the other. 

Talon: You would give to a fucking seasonal dish  
Lucian: So you lot are the new council, no respect for Kings, or goddesses?  
Alaric: Serefine would have been your greatest achievement all that raw power, had she mated with a wolf, full breed preferably but even half would have been something, she has no wolf blood, she is Zodiac's Heir entirely, but her heir might have been  
Talon: Our child Was destined to be great. 

Lucian: Has this boy ever spoken to my child  
Talon: I'll kill him  
Rhy: Calm  
Alaric: Honestly the old council did our people a disservice, our bloodline thinning, not keeping a better watch on each other, letting pedophiles run rampant, it's all bad honestly.  
Lucian: Ok well you need six members and I only see . of you 

Rhy: We thought we would come peacefully ask you to step down before we tell Will of his new position  
Lucian: WHAT?  
Rhy: He's the closest lineage-wise to being a council member.  
Lyall: And his son carries our blood  
Lucian: What were you lot just saying about thinning blood? 

Rhy: His half-breed is still within the Pack yours left, and now that his mate has left, we are asking Dandy to break the bond so he may be free  
Lucian: Thought this one out did you   
Alaric: The other Realms are rumbling everyone can feel a shift in the air, we are getting soft and weak, thats not a choice anymore, it's time things changed and we move forward in the right direction  
Rhy: Together  
Lyall:And stronger than ever 

Lucian: that was cute how long did you practice that for   
Talon: Why would you GIVER HER AWAY  
Lucian: Does my child even know you, like really know you how an intimate couple knows one another?  
Talon: Yes  
Lucian: No You is one lying ass boy, that girl is still a virgin, that little chicken shit's afraid to fuck if it was the other one I'd might believe you.  
Lucian laughed at his daughter's crossed admirer. 

Talon: There are other ways to be intimate, she WAS MY MATE MINE, FIRST YOU SENT HER TO WAR  
Lucian: You Really don't know shit boy that little blood bandit ran into war, "free bodies."  
Lucian gave his best imitaition.  
Talon: I LOVE   
Alaric: Gather him, and we leave, Lucian this is your notice you are no longer a council sitting member, we will see you tomorrow at the wedding  
Lucian began to laugh at the confusion of the others.  
Lucian: I'm not worried about the new council coming to the wedding, Oh and don't worry about Talon Zodiac will be at the wedding, she doesn't show mercy when it comes to her only Heir, There are still specks of the babysitter who called her chubby in the basement. 

Talon: My Serefine 

Putting on his favorite lingerie set, Trinity was determined this was the last night she had before Volcano day, and if she could just get a taste of whats to come then maybe it would silence all the fears and screaming in her head to run, far and hard. 

Trinity: Baby you sleep?  
Yuval: yes  
Trin: You just answered me  
Yuval begins to snore unnaturally loud.  
Trin: As accurate as that is, you not fooling anyone 

Yuval: It's tomorrow, it's in .. hours, go to sleep you, temptress of the skies  
Trin:...........what if after you change your mind?  
Yuval: Nigga, is it drugs? Change my mind\!\! That crowd better be lucky I don't take you right in front of them the torture you've put me through  
Trin: No I mean what if after the sex you don't want me anymore?  
Yuval: That's cute you've got cold feet, I don't have feet I have fins and I'm not going anywhere I haven't said it yet but till death do us part, and death to anyone who would part us I love you my Moon and my Stars  
Trin: I love you my Sun and my sky   
The day had come and everyone who could get their hands on an invitation was in attendance, the decorations were a reflection of when sky and sea unite on land .  
Lucian: My babies getting Married  
Mike: You think that means no more Genocide machine?  
Lucian: Don't be so optimistic if anything it means future tiny genocide machines 

Elly: Why is she going up the aisle it's not time  
Dex: Ooopps  
Eric: I'll get her 

Darkasha was none too please at her current seating arrangements when sudenly opritunity, and with his current silly play thing in the wedding, the least she could do is keep him company. Soulmate, he barely knew the bitch, she was a child, I'm his soulmate, he just has some confusion with old age.  
Kasha: Excuse me  
Will: Uhuh sure 

Will: This shit is already messy good thing I didn't bring the baby  
Talon stayed in the back filled with a rage that would have ripped him out of his skin before but held in place, He had originally planned to stop this farse before it started but his limbs wouldn't........................couldn't cooperate, the feeling was making his blood boil even more. 

Talon: I Won't let him have her  
\*the words barely a whisper, "WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?" He screamed inside his head, and then his inner voice was joined by another, "if it weren't for the fact I needed my baby's day to go off without a hitch, I'd use you as Ink and brush, painting this beach with your blood be still."  
Talon: where are you?  
Zodiac: Everywhere 

Trin: don't trip, don't trip, don't trip, long ass dress made for giants  
Celeste: I'm doing good?  
Trin: So good honey, so good 

Ale: Why are you here Darkasha?  
Kasha: I was invited same as you  
Ale: No why have you changed seats, you perfectly fine where you were  
Kasha: Why must you behave this way towards me?  
Ale: Because you refuse to understand that the past must die  
Kasha:..........Like our child? 

Mike: You think they know we can hear them  
Lucian: Let's not turn this wedding into a funeral, as long as he keeps answering correctly i'm not too worried  
Still Mike couldn't help but feel bad for Dex, the poor girl couldn't catch a break. 

Yuval: you look amazing  
Trin: Thanks, look, it has pockets.

Yuval: My love,  
From the moment we met over a decade ago, you became the light in my life. We've grown together, laughed together, and faced every challenge hand in hand. You’ve been my best friend, my partner, my safe place. Today, standing here with you, I know that my love for you is deeper than ever. 

Yuval: I vow to cherish every moment we have, both the quiet and the grand. To celebrate our victories, comfort you in our sorrows, and hold you close in every in-between. I promise to keep growing with you, to never take for granted the beautiful life we’ve built, and to always work to make it even better.  
I will be your strength when you need it, your laughter when you need joy, and your quiet when you need peace. I promise to love you, to respect you, and to always choose you—every single day, for the rest of our lives.

You are my everything, and I cannot wait to spend forever by your side. 

That's right big bro and you better too or we finna jump yo bitch ass. 

Trin: To my Vali, Hearing your words today brings back so many memories—of the years when we were just friends, when you were my anchor even before I realized just how much you meant to me. For all those years, you quietly held a space in my heart, even when I wasn’t sure what it was yet. You saw me through my highs and lows, and patiently waited until I realized what I now know so deeply—that my life is better, brighter, and fuller with you in it.  
I promise to cherish the love that grew between us, from friendship to something so much deeper. I vow to always see you, not just as the love of my life, but as the friend who stood by me, believed in me, and never gave up on us. 

They gonna make me cry, I can't cry right now, is Dex.....she already crying, Soft. 

Trin: I promise to hold your hand in every season, to be your support when life gets tough, and to share in the joy of every small and great moment. I vow to love you in a way that honors our past and embraces our future, because now I know that I need you—just as I did when I finally realized you were the one.

You are my friend, my love, and my forever, and I cannot wait to spend every day growing, laughing, and loving with you. 

Trin: Now's the time huh?  
Yuval: Yeah  
Zodiac: A Union Joined Sky and sea go forth and Live your Destiny, I now pronounce you man and wife, you may now kiss the bride.  
Trin: You sure? 

Trin: This is such a nice ring, look  
Yuval: Come here  
Trin: Wait hold on  
Yuval: Bring that ass girl 

. — . ..:.. AM

Trin: That wasn't so bad  
Yuval: You real pussy for such a badass  
Trin: Wild, where the courts at I need a divorce  
Yuval: Death do us part baby girl  
Trin: I can arrange that 

Yuval: you ready to go  
she absolutely hated when he put the daddy in his voice, it took all the wind out of her and left her feeling tiny.  
Trin: Yeah  
Yuval: lets go Misses Thalassaris, forever awaits   
Trin:ok  
Yuval had to laugh.  
Yuval: Ok  
Trin: What's funny stop laughing  
Yuval: I saw you jump on a guys shoulders once and rip his head off spine attached 

Trin: He was beating his wife  
He began to laugh even harder, and she was two seconds from a pout, he may be in dangerous waters but he was king of the Sea, so why be afraid,  
Yuval: Scared?  
Trin: NOOOOO,................ ok a little bit, Dex said it's gonna hurt  
Yuval: Come, you can take the lead until you're ready 

Trin: I kind of feel like you calling me pussy  
Yuval: Mmm, when did I say anything like that?  
Trin: if it hurts I'ma fuck you up  
Yuval: I mean, I like that type a shit so what you really saying  
Trin: You ready?  
Yuval: I was ready last month 

Trin: Ok but what if you don't like it, what if it feels weird or it's just not good  
Yuval: It's a shame you don't do drugs, you definitely need an edi right now  
Trin: no for real, I used to hear the pack talk wild crazy bout bitches they fucked who had trash pussy  
Yuval: First of all, Pack? More like a pack of bitches, second, you aren't some bitch you're my wife and I'm here for you through this whole thing ok, then after I'm coming in for me. 

Yuval: Baby  
Trin: I'm being stupid I know  
Yuval: No, your feelings are valid I love you so much, and I’m so grateful to share this moment with you. I want you to feel safe and comfortable, every step of the way. You’re my everything, and this isn’t about rushing anything—it’s about us being close and connecting in a way that feels right for both of us.  
Trin: This is silly it's our honeymoon, I'm holding things up 

Yuval: This is about both of us, and I want you to feel totally at ease. There’s no pressure, I’m just happy to be with you. I’m always here for you, and I’ll always take care of you. This is just one of many beautiful moments we’ll share together.  
Trin: I'm not making it beautiful, I'm being annoying, it's ok you can call a nymph if you don't feel like waiting  anymore. I wouldn't know how to do the things they could do anyway 

Yuval: You don’t have to feel like you need to be anything other than yourself for me. I fell in love with you for who you are—your kindness, your heart, and everything that makes you, you. You are more than enough, and I feel so lucky that you chose me. Please know that I’m here because I want to be with you, just as you are I understand that this might feel overwhelming, and it’s okay to feel that way. But please believe me when I say that there’s nothing you need to prove to me. Just having you in my life is more than I could ever ask for.  
You don’t have to be perfect, and I don’t want you to worry about being 'good' at anything. This isn’t about performance—it’s about us being close and sharing something special together.  
Trin: Ok, I think I'm ready 

Yuval: We’ll go as slowly as you need, and if it’s not tonight, that’s okay too. We have all the time in the world together, and the most important thing is that you feel loved and comfortable 

Yuval: You Ok? Is there anything I can do for you? Anything you need to feel more comfortable?  
Trin: just stay with me  
Yuval: Forever, I’m here with you, and I’m not going anywhere. Let’s just enjoy being together like this 

Yuval: I just want to hold you close for a while. You’re the most important person to me, and I want you to feel that  
Trin: ......ok

Yuval: What are you feeling?  
Trin: I don't wanna talk about them yet, it'll ruin it, and it was so perfect  
Yuval: Whatever you’re feeling is completely okay. If it felt a little overwhelming or if you have mixed feelings, that’s normal. I’m here for you, no matter what. We have so many more moments to share together, and I’m excited for every one of them, no matter what they look like.  
Trin: I'm tired  
Yuval: Rest, I'll be here in the morning and every morning from now until forever  
River: mmmm  
Mike: baby you feel so good  
River: Babe 

Mike: I know

Meanwhile across town at the Library of Etherwyn will found himself searching for The history of Etherwyn's waters the kingdom of Ocealyth being a single Dad to a half mermaid wasn’t as easy as he thought it would be. 

Lyxra:Third day in a row, do you need me to help you find something specific ?  
Will: I didn’t know libraries had limits.  
Lyxra: well fuck you then next time I won’t try to help you  
Will: I’m looking for a book 📖 on half breeds and raising them 

Lyxra:Awwww how cute I also have a tiny Mermaid half breed, I mean she’s not mine but legally she’s mine now.  
Will:This one is mine 💯 but I don’t know what I’m doing so I’m trying to get some research but it’s so hard, based off what I can find so far they don’t want anyone to know shit 

Lyxra: Well yeah outside of zodiac’s Kingdom, the mermaid kingdom is the next secret realm because we all roam around freely in the parts of the Realm that they allow us to be, but no one thinks about how vast the oceans of this world are, but we aren’t really allowed in the waters are we, except for a little frolicking, I heard other worlds they have scuba diving and all those things, all we know is the women are intoxicating, so very rarely do you cross genitalia with a female and not fall into obsession.  
Will: Careful don’t want King Yuval to hear you speak on such things.  
Lyxra: oh noooo I’m a big fan. Still hoping he gets his hands on the piece of shit that attacked his sister, if we’re lucky, he’ll go live and let us watch 

River: Pastor Good I need Council  
PGood: River you are one of my strongest sheep, but as of late I see you straying from the flock, what troubles you my dear?  
River: I believe I'm being punished  
PGood: I Know that poor child's conception was truly a horrid crime, but god makes no mistakes.  
River: No. oh God no I love Mikey with all my heart he's my piece of Heaven on earth 

PGood: So then what troubles you child for it is we who are the circumcision, we who serve God by his Spirit, who boast in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh, though I myself have reasons for such confidence.  
If someone else thinks they have reasons to put confidence in the flesh, I have more.  
River: That's what I've done Pastor......................................................................................... I've placed confidence in the flesh, I've done things I knew weren't pleasing to the lord and now I believe he punishes me for it 

PGood: God does not Punish my love, God allows people to experience the consequences of their choices, such as suffering in this life or eternal death, and you need to rectify your behavior before the second option if you're really telling me you're backsliding, I can't even call it that you have been a straight and narrow since you were a little girl, what's going on  
River: I've been fornicating  
PGood:Nooo\!\!\!\!\!\! 

River: As you know before my only experience with.............. that was what happened with Mikey and then.......  
PGood: Speak freely child it's not on me to pass judgment it's for me to council you so you may get back on the right track into the arms of the lord, you've found yourself turning in the sheets with the devil  
River: Not necessarily the devil, he's a werewolf though  
PGood:Excuse me? 

PGood:I got to say you are not the member of my flock I could ever picture falling so far from grace  
River: and now I feel I'm being pun.............I'm being shown what it's like out of his Favor..................................................................I lost my babies this weekend  
PGood: Babies?  
River:With twins, I lost them, but I'm so confused, we were getting married, he asked me to marry him, we were going to do things the right way  
PGood: You say were, do you prefer the idea of living in sin now? 

River: No, now I don't know if getting married will even fix things, it kind of feels like putting a band-aid on a bullet wound  
PGood:  Matthew .:.. says, "For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you". Forgiveness is a gift from God that removes sins and restores relationships. It's a choice to receive forgiveness, and it's a reminder that we should forgive others as God has forgiven us. That means you too, you must forgive yourself After receiving God's forgiveness, the Bible says that a key part of repentance is to distance yourself from your sins and focus on being a better person.  
River:Yeah I've already said no more sex until after the wedding 

PGood: You believe it's just that act alone that has brought sin into your life  
River: I don't know what you mean  
PGood: Think about your life since that boy has entered it, think about the things that has happened have they been good wholesome things like before, I noticed you've even missed a couple of Sundays has this man enriched your relationship with god?  
River: He's my Mate 

PGOOD: Are you also a Dog sister?  
River: Pastor  
PGood: I'm sorry my dear, but I must be frank you seem to be locked in this delusional lust-filled state where you are enjoying the pleasures of the flesh and so you are looking for excuses  
River: Oh God 

River: Pastor what do I do?  
PGood: You have to take the Dog back to the shelter, get a puppy that doesn't hump  
River: Pastor  
But she smiled, a weak thank you I appreciate you trying to make me feel better but my whole world is falling apart smile.  
PGood: Then you come to service on Sunday we see if we don't find you a nice Deacon 

River: I think I'll be staying away from the dating scene after this, I'm just gonna concentrate on the word  
PGood: So I'm a bad Pastor is what you're saying?  
River: What ? Oh Goodness no I would never say that, I  
Pgood: Cause I was SURE, I taught my flock, that God said be fruitful, and multiply, and you can't do that by your single self 

River:  Pastor Good  
Pgood: Call me Ron  
River: I couldn't  
PGood: I am a man of God but I am still just flesh and blood you can call me by my given name  
River: Well , ummmm, see the thing is no one here wants me after what happened I'm dirty goods, oooh that's the daycare. 

Pgood: fools then the whole lot of them for how could they see a treasure a beauty a god fearing strong woman like you and believe you to be anything less than worthy?  
River: in a way they were right though.   
PGood: we’ve all fallen short of his grace that makes us human  
River: have you ever fallen  
PGood: I’m no Angel anymore I fell a long, long time ago and I’ve done everything to let my father see, I am worthy of his forgiveness. 

Trying to sleep was almost impossible, leave Mike, but so much craziness had entered her life since he entered it starting with that very first night, maybe they just weren't meant to be together, these could have all been signs she had been ignoring, trying to ignore the flesh was so very hard, he made her feel things she had never, so much felt right in his hands, but the devil is always properly dressed, Sin is always the most attractive thing on the table, now it was the tears she had to fight back because God, she thought she had found her happily ever after. 

Since the Tears had started and she knew there would be no stopping them she decided it was time to talk to god, and she began to sing.  
River: Heaven, hear me now, I'm lost without a cause, After giving it my all  
Winter storms have come, And darkened my sun, After all that I've been through, Who on earth can I turn to? I look to You  
I look to You, After all my strength is gone, In You, I can be strong, I look to You  
I look to You, yeah, And when melodies are gone, In You, I hear a song  
I look to You, About to lose my breath, There's no more fighting left, Sinking to rise no more  
Searching for that open door, And every road that I've taken, mm, Led to my regret  
And I don't know if I'm gon' make it, Nothing to do but lift my head 

Caleb: Boss  
Will: Don't call me that  
Caleb: You the boss man now  
Will: Hardly, it's a collective we working to fix shit them old niggas fucked up 

Caleb: Ok Where you headed ?

Caleb: He's a wreck, cause he hasn't heard from her since the day it happened, he thinks she's blaming him, says his inner beast had taken over and he was a little rough and now he's lost her, I think she just needs some time 

Will: Not everyone can just let go you know, not everyone handles it so well as you did  
Caleb: Let go?

Will: Here is the thing, more adorable than sexy, like a Rabbit with a switchblade  
Caleb: Cute  
Will: Very, and she was helping me find books on mermaid half breeds, but that's it, she's good conversation, that's it, plus I can't get a scent on her, I think she gotta be the cleanest human I've ever smelt but I can't place anything else  
Caleb: O, just be careful   
Lyxra: Hey Fridge  
Will: Really?  
Lyxra: Yup, you're big as hell and you got like three shirts with Frieza on  
Will: Funny guy, you're a funny gyal  
Lyxra: Eh I try 

Maybe it was the Angle, were her breasts always this big? Why am I checking her out, fuck what's she saying.  
Lyxra: And I'm telling her Minecraft's worlds, The randomly generated worlds in Minecraft are so vast that it would take .seven,... years to explore every possible world. But you know kids  
Will: Well mine is only . he's about to be two so I have a while before big-time gaming talk  
Lyxra: It's the worst best, she's like the little sister I always wanted but she's My niece and every answer is followed by a new Question 

Will: She'd get tired of me, I'd have an answer for everyone  
Lyxra: Lol Ok then when she starts with What is H.O? Who is James Bond? What is paella? What is Angkor Wat?  
Will: the chemical symbol for water. He is a famous spy known as ..seven. national dish of Spain is a rice dish typically made with saffron and seafood. The ancient temple complex in Cambodia is the largest religious monument in the world. it's like Revers Jeopardy  
Lyxra: Ok if I need a babysitter I know who to call 

Will: does she play well with Toddlers  
Alyxra: I'm not really sure  
Will: We might both get a win, you get a babysitter, and I get a mini babysitter  
Alyxra: smart, if anything she could probably teach him to make water dance it's her favorite thing to do, she says she's been doing it since she was about two  
Will: Sounds like a play date is in order 

Lyx: Sure, let's do this  
Will: He's somewhat of wild, baby pups are   
Lyx: You're a wolf  
Will: Yes, Problem?  
Lyx: You......you don't smell wolf 

Will: How bad did the ones you met smell,........you're not human  
Lyxra: No, you thought I was a human  
Will: Yeah, You don't smell of anything else and my nose never fails me  
Lyxra: Mine fails me all the time, Poor excuse for a vampire  
Will: Impossible, There is no way to hide that scent of death  
Lyxra: OH, I'm Vegan, I don't kill  
Will: Nigga what? 

Jake: Ok Time to get all this nonsense over and done with . months of no call nothing not answering anything, she has to understand she's blowing this thing up way harder than needed to be, all-cause she didn't want to admit she may have made a mistake, and you know what I'm past that, let's just. 

Mallory: JAKE\!\!\!\! What are you doing here  
Jake: You never came home, and I'm guessing something happened to your phone  
Mallory: I told you when I left I wasn't coming back Jake, I meant it, How did you get in?  
Jake: You didn't lock the door  
Mallory: I'm gonna fuck ing  
Jake: What? 

Mallory: Nothing look you have to go   
Jake: I'm not going without us talking  
Mallory: Now you want to talk, . months too late  
Jake: You left . months ago Mally  
Mallory: You don't talk when the other person is heading out the door you talk when they are in your face and showing you that they need you 

Jake: I wasn't there for you  
Mallory: Not really and you know what we were both at fault we were both in unhealthy spaces and dealing with the other poorly   
Jake: So then lets  
Mallory: I'm gonna stop you right there I'm in a healthy space now and I'm not trying to spin the block with you plus It's parts of me you wouldn't be ok with and that's ok you deserve a partner you can be ok with and I deserve a partner I can be my complete self with. 

Jake When did I stop you from being you, when did I stifle anything about you I have always promoted your growth, you don't have to want me back but that character attack was a lot and hurtful  
Mallory: Stop no, it's not that simple, no you didn't not, I did, I stifled myself because I knew you wouldn't be ok with certain things, and I loved you so much I thought I could be ok if I just let this one little part of me die  
Jake: But that's not fair you never gave me a chance to chime in before deciding 

Mallory: I'm Poly  
Jake: Ok I take it back you were right  
Mallory: Yeah I know  
Jake: So, the whole time we were together you were just sad and wishing you had another dick for when you got bored with mine??  
Mallory: Get the fuck out my house Jacob 

Jake: No for real, I never understood the whole thing like why if someone was in a happy relationship would they want anyone else  
Mallory: Because love doesn't work the same for everyone, multiple romantic or sexual relationships with the knowledge and consent of all partners.  
Jake: Sounds like an open relationship, or swinging not something people who are in love would do, but we always joked that I loved you way more than you loved me  
Mallory: You Know, you're really close-minded and stubborn for someone who works in a field where you deal with all types of people, is that why you really left the hospital? Got tired of seeing families with . moms and three dads 

Jake: I can respect other's choices and not want them for myself, love, what's good for the Goose isn't always good for the Gander, just because all your friends are smoking crack doesn't mean you're going to pick up a pipe does it  
Mallory: Is that what this is? you smoking crack, you walking into my house with.....the, uh, the fuck are you doing cause I just know this ain't your attempt at getting me back you know what no, no please leave 

Jake: Mallory\!\!  
Mallory: The door since you've lost your way  
Jake: I have  
Mallory: Have what?  
Jake: Lost my way, that's why I'm here 

Jake: I thought I was desperately trying to keep my family together which is why I behaved so stupidly, not realizing you are my family and I was pushing you away with my antics, . months away from you was driving me insane, went back to the hospital to find out you left, losing my head  
Mallory: You left first, you said you cared about those kids but you just abandoned them to play Daddy dearest.  
Jake: Which is why, I didn't leave again after finding you missing But 

Jake: Baby   
Mallory: Jake wait   
Jake: I did . months 

The kiss, fuck, it took so long to forget the physical chemistry and just one kiss and it was back no,no,no good dick be damned this man needed a therapist and that was above her pay grade.  
Mallory: I have a boyfriend 

Trying to find her balance as she stood on her own two feet again, feeling like she stole them, she at least accomplished one thing he let her go, need a chair though cause got to sit, head spinning.  
Jake: And I have a Girlfriend, is what I've kept saying cause I know   
Mallory: NO STOP\!\!\!\! Jake, I moved on I have a boyfriend, someone who cares for me who I am in a relationship with 

Jake: And he's ok with you being.......  
Mallory: Polyamorous? Yes we both are  
Jake: So then the kiss is fine  
Mallory: No, he didn't consent to that, matter of fact neither did I But  
Jake: You liked it 

Sage: Still hella rapey, you ok babe?  
Jake: Babe? No  
Sage: Yes  
Jake: Maly, you are not dating Sisqo's little brother Crisco  
Sage: Did the bad man hurt you, my love 

Mallory: I'm fine babe, Jake was just leaving  
Jake: You're asking me to leave for this........I'd call him a tool but that would imply he may be useful, he looks like something I drew with my left hand  
Sage: I had zero expectations and you still let me down. I envy people who haven't met you.  
Jake: You should carry a plant around with you to replace the oxygen you waste.  
Mallory:ok can this stop 

Sage: I'm sorry baby I wasn't even sure, you said Jake had a big christmas beard, where'd you get this little bitch faced boy  
Mallory: SAGE\!\!\!\!  
Jake: I needed this, ok umm I have no plans of embarrassing myself any further, I thought in getting to know someone I could prevent things like this from happening.  
Mallory: It was a foul on both our parts 

Sage: Being too kind again love  
Jake: Me oh no, this was on you deception  
Mallory: Excuse me  
Jake: We were together for . years, you just told me you were lying the whole time and hiding your sexuality because it would ensure our relationship 

Mallory: Thats not what happened but go off  
Jake: Thank you I plan to  
Sage: Let me just  
Jake: I wish the fuck you would shine boy, call the village and tell them they lost they idiot when I'm done with yo ass  
Mallory: JAKE\!\!\!\!\! 

Jake: Oh yeah you, let's talk about how I laid my everything on the table for you, hoping we could just get to know each other but your dick-hungry ass was hiding Key aspects of yourself because you just wanted to get ya pussy pulsed then made me out to be the boogie man because you felt you had to keep up a charade you put on to get fucked, but tell me more about how I'm the bad guy, for being the only one being honest and trying to pay attention  
The tears were big and forceful, and Mallory's body was shaking with anger and guilt, was he right did she doom them from lying from the beginning she had to walk away. 

Jake:when you first left I kept asking myself Without you there'd be no sun in my sky, there would be no love in my life  
There'd be no world left for me, and now I see I didn't even know you, walk away from me but you can't walk away from the truth  
Sage: Get the fuck out my house bro before I know you the fuck out  
Jake: You need to knock that relaxer out, out here looking like you make blind kids cry  
Sage: And she still chose me   
Lyx: Found anything good  
Will: I think so actually just working up figuring out if I'm gonna take this one out or not  
Lyx: Oh, which is it?  
Will: Potty training your pup 

Lyx: OOOfff I don't envy you, luckily mine came with bathroom mechanics preinstalled  
Will: That's cute, how's she doing?  
Lyx: Pretty good, enjoying her new school and the kids and settling kind of decent  
Will: that's great, meanwhile JJ is flinging his shit 

Lyx: you are my daily dose of Birth Control did you know that  
Will: Well tell your boyfriend you're welcome, unless he wanted kids then tell him sucks to be him  
Lyx: I don't have one My abstinence is my actual daily birth control, you're just a good back up  
Will released a loud deep laugh before the chorus of shhhh's reminded him he was in a library. 

Will: Right no talking  
Lyx: At least you're not the Librarian with the loud person  
Will: Can I take you out?  
Lyx: What?  
Will: I'd like to have a convo without the shhh's and so, Yeah?  
Lyx: I must be crazy, yeah ok lets, I heard we're mixing it up these days anyway  
Will: Don't remind me 

Jake: Ok I've got the Bong, the weed her orb am I missing anything?  
\*It had gotten to this point, he wanted something real something tangible he wanted to do things the right way but that blew up in his face so now he needed to take out his frustration and only one being could handle that so he prepared himself to summon her, it's been a while but he doubt that would matter as long as he had her offerings. 

\*Jake stands alone in the dimly lit room, the cool air brushing against his bare skin, clad only in his boxers. Around him, dozens of candles flicker, their flames casting eerie, dancing shadows against the walls. A large pentagram is drawn meticulously on the floor beneath him, its lines etched in chalk, glowing faintly in the dim light. Emboldened by the hunger that drives him.  
He raises his hands slowly, palms open toward the darkened ceiling and begins to chant. His voice, low and trembling at first, grows steadier with each word. The air around him hums with a strange, unnatural energy, vibrating with the power of his incantation.  
Jake: “Keonaona,” he whispers, his voice full of reverence and desire. “Queen of shadows, mistress of night, hear me.” 

Jake: From depths where light dares not to tread,  
I summon thee from among the dead.  
Keonaona, whisperer of doom,  
Rise now from the endless gloom.  
By blood I bind, by shadow I seal,  
Come forth, my will you shall now feel. 

Jake: The flames of the candles flicker wildly as if stirred by a sudden wind. The temperature drops, and a dark energy fills the room. His heart races, the thrill of what he’s doing rushing through him.

Jake:I do not call you for servitude, Keonaona. I call you to fulfill my whims, my deepest desires. Come to me, and together we shall indulge in the pleasures of this world and beyond.

The air grows thick, oppressive. Shadows curl around the edges of the pentagram, twisting and writhing like living things. He stands, breath quickened, awaiting her arrival with a mix of lust and power.

Jake:Keonaona, he breathes, his voice hushed yet commanding. “Come to me.” 

Jake:From the shadowed realms beyond the veil,  
I call the one with wings so frail.  
Keonaona, spirit of the night,  
Come forth and bathe in pale moonlight.  
With blood, with breath, I seal this bond,  
To thee, my soul, I shall respond.  
By flame, by fire, by earth and sea,  
Keonaona, come unto me\!

O Queen of Desire, with lips of flame,  
Hear now the call and speak thy name.  
Keonaona, rise from the abyss,  
Grant me your power, seal with a kiss\!" 

The shadows converge, and from them, a shape begins to form—a dark, seductive figure, drawn by the lure of his desires, answering his call. And with a kiss she bought her temporary freedom and with one of her favorite toys she thought this one had been lost for good, he tasted different, he was alone, where was the other half? 

Keo: Where's Jackie  
Jake: We separated  
Keo: Ouch, oh my love muffin, feeling impatient  
Jake: I'll say sorry from now, The control is almost non-existent  
Keo: ooooh yes, threaten me with a good time 

Jake: If I didn't know better, I'd Rip your clothes off right here, but since I don't want to be trapped in the Shadowspire for all eternity  
Keo: And why not, I'm a great companion  
Jake: No thanks  
Keo: So what happened love why have we gone wild with hunger?  
The memory of his turmoil brought emotions he didn't want to feel, taking larger steps he hurried to the bedroom and removed his boxers knowing hers would disappear. 

With a swift motion, he sheaths himself inside her, filling her to the brim. He sets a relentless pace, pounding into her with powerful thrusts that send shockwaves of pleasure through both their bodies.  
Jake: That's it, take it all,   
grunting, his grip on her hips tightening as he drives deeper.  
Jake: Scream for me, Honey. Let everyone know who's fucking you senseless right now. 

This is why he needed Keo nails digging into his shoulders as he continued to ravage her with primal intensity. The sound of skin slapping against skin fills the room, he keeps a tight Grip on her giving her his full length every time.  
Keo: Oh God I don't know what she did but I'm sending her flowers 

why did she have to say that setting a punishing rhythm that had her crying out with each brutal penetration. The bed creaks beneath their frenzied coupling, the headboard slamming against the wall with each forceful thrust. 

With a low growl, he claimed her mouth in a searing kiss, his tongue delving deep to tangle with hers. His hands roaming her curves, kneading and squeezing as he explores every inch of her willing flesh.   
Keo: "Aww puppet are you crying" she said kissing away the tears he hadn't even felt rolling down. "Oh no she hurt you real bad huh?" whispering ever so softly in his ear "Fill me up, Daddy." 

Reaching down to rub her clit in time with his thrusts, sending her hurtling towards a shattering climax. With a final, brutal push, Jake buries himself to the hilt and erupts inside his little she-devil, flooding her depths with his hot seed.  
Keo: You really are a favorite, so rarely do I get a contract that is not a complete and total buzz kill. 

Jake: How long are you mine for?  
Keo: You were very specific boss with that summon, you're calling the shots this time, so you tell me  
Jake: A year  
Keo: A year????? why so long 

Jake: I just reopened the Bar and went back to the hospital  
Keo: Holy shit you left the hospital, hurray for a regenerating pussy this is gonna get rough  
Jake: I just know I have a lot of business to handle and a  
Keo: Living sex doll?  
Jake: Companion would make for good stress relief 

Keo: So a year?  
Jake: Yes  
Keo: are you sure, you remember my regular rules, I fuck who I want when you aren't there to satisfy me, I don't do blood frenzies, and no friends  
Jake: yes thats fine  
Keo: Ok I'm yours 

Keo: You want some more? I kinda need to go clothes shopping if I'm going to be here a full year  
Jake: No, take my card get some clothes, and remember for the next year, every inch of this sweet cunt belongs to me. I'm going to fill you up until you can't take anymore.  
Keo: Stop or I'm gonna want some more, you so nasty when you're mad 

Jake: Sure you don't want me to come?  
Keo: Yes, gonna end up fucking me in someones changing room and you don't know how to chill so no, cause I'm not trying to get caught screaming and hollering cross-eyed   
Jake: Ok, be good 

Keo: no promises  
Leaning down he kissed her tenderly on the forehead.  
Jake: I know  
Keo: What was that  
Jake: What nothing  
Keo: Papito 

. — . ..:.. AM  
Jake: What's wrong?  
Keo: Don't do that, this is already a super unhealthy coping mechanism, but I love the dick, don't spend a year being Ghey, and then when it's time to leave you lose yourself.  
Jake: I'm fine I was just saying bye, go, have fun 

Pastor Good’s hand hovered inches from the door, ready to knock, but something pulled him back. It was subtle at first—a whisper in the wind, a tickle at the nape of his neck—but soon it became impossible to ignore. The sensation of being watched crept over him like a shadow stretching toward him, pulling him into its grip.  
He turned his head, his eyes scanning the street, and there she was.  
Standing on the sidewalk, her figure bathed in the soft glow of the setting sun. She was too still, too calm, as if she had been waiting for this moment. Her lips curved into a smile—sharp, almost predatory—while her eyes sparkled with a kind of mischievous familiarity that made his pulse quicken.  
Keo: Well, would you look at that,she purred, her voice cutting through the silence like a blade.\* “Hello,Remiel Long time no see.”

Pastor Good felt his chest tighten at the sound of his Heavenly name. The voice was unmistakable, yet it hit him like a slap to the face, dredging up memories he had fought to suppress. His entire body went rigid as he stood there, caught between disbelief and the eerie pull of her presence. 

Keo: Oh, this is going to be fun, she said, stepping forward with an almost deliberate slowness, each footstep measured, her gaze locked onto his. “I never expected you here, of all places.”  
Her words dripped with a hidden meaning, the kind of amusement that danced just on the edge of cruelty. She knew more than she was letting on, and the way her eyes glinted in the fading light sent a wave of heat through him, one he hadn’t felt in years.  
Keo: Nothing to say? she teased, her voice lilting with false innocence. “You know, I almost missed that brooding silence of yours.” 

Lyx: Not at all what I was expecting, like at all  
Will: Pleasant surprise?  
Lyx: Umm yeah, very pleasant  
Will: What's with the smile 

Lyx: I try, really hard not to be judgy and Biased......... but you are not what I think when I think werewolf  
Will: I'm super Judgy and Biased, and same, you are so far left of my thought's on bloodsuckers I still think you're fucking with me  
Lyx:  the big as-hell part ok yeah, you transform into a Giant wolf so that makes sense but like, I've seen short wolfs so I didn't figure that part, and everything else is a stunner  
Will: I'm an Alpha Wolf My beast is about the size of this building, I don't think any type of Magic could tuck that into a . foot man 

Lyx: I still get blown away by that whole transition, I've seen videos but jeez  
Will: Videos? Oh some young dumb pup just showing off  
Lyx: No I Study Biology and herbology, it was a documentary  
Will: Oh, ok Miss Nose in a Book, what do you like to do when you don't have your nose in a book  
Lyx: I'm in my garden, or on a run 

Will: A run, you lot like to run  
Lyx: Yeah little puppy, and I'm probably faster than you  
Will: I'd like to see that  
Lyx: Is that a challenge? 

Will leaned forward, a grin spreading across his face. "Oh, it's definitely a challenge. But don’t come crying to me when you lose, fangs."  
Lyx raised an eyebrow, her lips curling into a smirk. "Lose? Please. I could outrun you in heels."  
Will chuckled, shaking his head. "You might be fast, but I’ve got stamina. That’s something you won’t find in your books or documentaries."  
"Oh, is that so?" she teased, leaning in closer, her eyes gleaming with intrigue. "What else are you hiding, Will? Stamina and charm? You might just surprise me."  
"Stick around, and you’ll find out," Will said, his voice dropping to a playful, almost daring tone.

Lyx tilted her head, her gaze locking onto his. "Maybe I will," she replied softly, a spark of challenge in her eyes. 

Will leaned back in his chair, arms on his legs with a confident smirk. "Oh, you’ll stick around, all right. I’ve got more surprises than you think."  
Lyx’s eyes gleamed as she gave him a once-over. "I do like surprises. Just hope you’re not all bark, little puppy."  
Will laughed, shaking his head. "You really love calling me that, don’t you? But I’m no pup, I'm big Dawg. I can prove it whenever you’re ready."  
"Prove it, huh?" Lyx said, biting her lip playfully, her gaze lingering on his. Will’s grin widened, catching the meaning behind her words. "Not scared of anything are you? Same except maybe beating you too badly. Might hurt your ego.  
Lyx leaned forward, her elbows resting on the table, her fingers tracing the edge of her wine glass. " You think I’m fragile? I’ve been around a long time, Will. I’ve faced things much scarier than a werewolf with a little swagger."  
"Oh, I’m sure you have," he teased. "But I’ll bet you’ve never had someone challenge you like this before. I’m not like the others."  
She smirked, leaning even closer. "No, you’re definitely not. I like that. Keeps things interesting."  
The playful energy between them simmered, but as their eyes met again, the air shifted slightly—something deeper lingering beneath the surface. 

The playful energy between them simmered, but as their eyes met again, the air shifted slightly—something deeper lingering beneath the surface.  
"So," Will said, his voice lowering, "what’s really driving you? I mean, you study biology, herbology… you run. That’s not the usual ‘nightlife’ for your kind."  
Lyx’s playful expression softened, just for a moment. "I guess I just like understanding how things work. I’m fascinated by life, how it all connects. Maybe it’s because I’m so far removed from it. Being a vampire… it’s like you see everything differently. But I like to feel grounded."  
Will nodded, his gaze steady. "Yeah, I get that. I feel more at home in the woods than anywhere else. Guess that’s why I’m always running."  
"Running away or running toward something?" she asked, a hint of curiosity lacing her tone.  
He paused, thinking for a second. "Maybe a bit of both. Hard to tell sometimes." 

Will smirked at her challenge but something in Lyx’s tone, a subtle shift beneath her playful words, caught his attention. He leaned in, his gaze more intense now, dropping the banter. "You said you like running too. What are you running from, Lyx?"  
Her smirk faltered, and for a moment, the confident facade she wore cracked, just slightly. She straightened in her seat, taking a sip from her wine glass to buy herself a moment. "I wasn’t expecting you to dive into the heavy questions this early," she said, trying to regain her composure.  
Will didn’t let up. "We all run from something, right? You can tell me."  
Will’s smirk faded as he noticed Lyx’s hesitation. "So, what are you running from?" he asked, his tone more serious.  
Lyx looked away, her fingers tightening around her wine glass. "My nieces father,I don't know what I'd do if yuval decided hey I can't find him lets get the family, I heard it was bad. I didn’t know until after it happened."

Will’s jaw clenched as the pieces fell into place. His voice was tight, almost disbelieving. "That was my ex-Mate."

Lyx froze, eyes wide. "What? I didn’t know… Will, I swear, I had no idea, Ex-Mate can you guys do that." 

Lyx stared at him, shock written all over her face. "I didn’t know, Will. I didn’t… I would’ve never come here if I had."  
Will's hands clenched into fists under the table, trying to control the surge of emotions coursing through him. "My .........Elly ," he repeated, his voice strained. "She was taken… but the things your brother wanted to do to her."  
Lyx shook her head slowly, the weight of realization hitting her. "I’m so sorry. I had no idea it was her. I’ve Nothing to say for him, I just found out about my niece After he ran away, he had a ten year old and I didn't know, this was our relationship." 

Will blinked, stunned by the revelation. "She's your brother's kid?"  
Lyx nodded, her voice thick with frustration and guilt. "Yes. I found out after he ran off. He kept so much from me… this is how distant we are. Our relationship has been nothing but silence and lies for years."  
Will stepped back, his anger momentarily interrupted by the shock of this new layer to her story. "You didn’t even know about your niece?" He shook his head, still trying to process everything. "What kind of family does that?"  
"A broken one," Lyx muttered bitterly, looking down at her hands. "We haven’t been close for a long time, Will. My brother… he’s been lost to his darkness for years, and I’ve been trying to escape the shadow he cast over me. But I never expected this." 

Will stared at her, his emotions a storm of conflicting feelings—anger, shock, sadness. Part of him wanted to walk away, to leave her and put distance between them. But another part of him saw the pain in Lyx’s eyes, the genuine regret that mirrored his own loss.  
Silence hung heavy between them for a moment before   
Lyx spoke again, her voice barely above a whisper. "I never wanted any of this. I can’t undo what he did, Will. But if there’s anything I can do to make it right… I want to help."

Will clenched his jaw, looking at her, unsure what to believe. But something about her words—the honesty in them—stirred a crack in his wall of anger. He couldn’t bring himself to believe that Lyx was the same as her brother. The woman next to him wasn’t the monster who had destroyed his life. 

"I guess we've all got a brother that does dumb shit and puts us in holes," he muttered, the bitterness in his voice softened just a little by a hint of understanding.

Lyx looked up, surprised, a faint smile tugging at the corner of her lips. "Yeah," she whispered, a trace of relief in her voice. "Guess we do."

For a moment, they sat in silence, the tension between them easing just slightly. It wasn’t forgiveness, but it was a step toward something less sharp, something almost like understanding.

Will rubbed a hand over his face, sighing. "It’s not easy to let this go. I don’t know if I can."

Lyx nodded. "I don’t expect you to. I don’t even know how I’d deal with it if I were you." 

He turned toward her, their eyes locking for the first time since the revelation. The pain was still there in his chest, but the raw anger had started to cool. "You’re not him. I know that much."  
She swallowed, her voice barely above a whisper. "Thank you."  
Will let out a slow breath, the weight of everything still pressing on him, but he couldn’t bring himself to pull away from her completely. Instead, he found himself lingering, his body betraying the conflict in his mind.  
Lyx shifted, her eyes never leaving his, and for the first time, she seemed smaller, vulnerable. "I never wanted to be tied to his mistakes," she said, her voice soft. "I’ve spent so long running from it all."  
He hesitated for only a moment before reaching out, his arm moving around her shoulders, tentative at first. Lyx stiffened, surprised, but when his grip tightened, drawing her closer, she leaned into him. Slowly, cautiously, as if testing the fragile connection between them, she let her arms circle around him in return.  
"God you're huge." 

“I don’t know if I can trust you yet,” he admitted, his voice low but steady. “But I want to try.”

Lyx looked up at him, her eyes searching his. “I’ll do whatever it takes to earn that trust, Will. I promise.”

His heart raced at her words, a glimmer of hope flickering within the shadows of doubt. Slowly, he pulled her fully against him, fool what are you doing his mind was screaming. 

"What are you doing?" She asked Tentatively   
 \*but he didn’t let go of her. Instead, he looped his arm around her waist, grounding himself in her presence.

Taking her in for the first time, she had a scent, still not of Death it was soft like Lavender, it was...............pleasant.  
"Will?" 

With a gentle motion, he lifted a hand to caress her face, his thumb brushing softly along her cheek. “I see you, Lyx. I see the person you are… not the one your family made you out to be.”

Her breath hitched at the unexpected tenderness, and she leaned into his touch, feeling the warmth spread through her. “Thank you for seeing me,” she whispered, her voice barely audible.

Will's heart swelled with an emotion he hadn’t expected to feel so soon—an undeniable connection that was starting to grow amidst the chaos. As he held her gaze, he felt the barriers between them start to shift, and for the first time, but not yet he would not allow himself to believe that there could be something more. 

Will raised an eyebrow, a teasing smirk playing at the corners of his lips. "A vampire exposing her neck? That's new. You know werewolves bite too?"  
Lyx met his gaze, her expression confident. "I'm not afraid, only to mate and hunt" she responded,  
"Right now, it feels like I’m doing both," he replied, his voice low and laced with a hint of challenge.  
The tension between them is palpable yet playful. "I’ll keep that in mind. Just remember, I bite back."

Lyx laughed, a lightness filling the air between them. "Then maybe we should see who hunts better."

"Challenge accepted," he said, a grin spreading across his face. 

He stood frozen, his mind racing. She was playing with him, testing the waters, seeing how far she could push him before he cracked. And though he wasn’t about to give in to her game, he couldn’t deny the pull.  
For a moment, his eyes flicked to the door—Deacon White just beyond it, completely unaware of the storm brewing on his doorstep. Remiel was inches away from a simple visit, yet he stood trapped in a battle he wasn’t ready to fight. 

Not yet.

PGood: I thought we were done with this,  
Remiel finally said, his voice low and controlled, though the tension thrummed beneath it. Her smile only widened.  
Keo: Oh, Remiel... we’ll never be done. I rreallllly like the new skin, but I could smell you from a mile away, its's nice, let me taste it. 

PGood:Is this what you truly want?  
he asked, his voice low and strained, a blend of temptation and hesitation. “To take me down this path again?”  
She smiled, a sultry glimmer in her eyes, without taking his cock from her mouth, she hummed as slurped him up, a feeling that sent a shiver down his spine.\* 

Elly: Take Off the skin  
Remiel felt the walls he had built around his heart begin to crumble as he lost himself in her, surrendering to the moment despite the turmoil within.  
Remiel: What am I doing? I shouldn’t be here… I shouldn’t want this. 

Keo: Don’t think, just feel. You’ve been denied for so long. You taste so yummy Remmy, won't you fuck me?  
he fought against the wave of pleasure threatening to sweep him away. Oh the magic she worked with that tongue.  
 Remiel: I’m a fallen angel, I shouldn’t enjoy this… I shouldn’t be with you.  
Keo: Yet here you are, You can deny it all you want, but deep down, you crave this just as much as I do. 

He moaned softly, torn between the ecstasy of their connection and the guilt that gnawed at him. Every sensation was a reminder of the line he was crossing, but as they moved together, his questions faded into the background, lost in the depths of desire.\*  
PGood: What have I become?” he whispered, his voice trembling with the weight of his confession.  
Keo: Something beautiful, Embrace it, Remmy. You were never meant to be just a guardian. You were created to feel, to experience everything this world has to offer.”  
Her words struck a chord deep within him, an unsettling truth he couldn’t ignore. As her firm ass pressed against his cock, he was torn between ecstasy and regret. Memories of his former life flickered through his mind—of purity, purpose, and the unwavering light he had once embodied. 

Remiel: I want to be forgiven,  
Keo: Redemption doesn’t come from denying your desires, Remiel. It comes from embracing them. You’re more than just a fallen angel; you’re alive in this moment. Let go of your guilt. As one of the first fallen you can Roam the earth freely, and you waste it trying to save humans  
Remiel: as opposed to.......sleeping with them?  
Keo: Enjoying your freedom. 

Keo: You know, you really are a fool, Remiel.  
PGood: What do you mean?  
Keo: Here we are, basking in the aftermath of something divine, and you’re already retreating into your old habits, Trying to save the souls of humans, as if that’s your purpose anymore. Why not enjoy your freedom for once?  
PGood: They’re lost, struggling against their own darkness. If I have any power left, I should use it to help them 

Keo: Help them? Do you think they’re worthy of your sacrifice?   
PGood: They deserve a chance  
Keo: Maybe it’s time to stop clinging to your guilt, You’re free now, Remiel. Embrace it. Stop trying to be the savior and start living for yourself. You’re more than just a fallen angel; you’re a creature of desire. Enjoy it. I tasted the desire Remmy  
Remiel: Noooooo  
Keo: Oh yes, yes I did 

Keo: Who is she Remmy, who is it that you desire so much, it's making me wet again thinking about it  
PGood: No  
Keo: OOhhhh put the strict face on? No use, it appears someone is here to see you, and not that version of you  
His senses were off when the doorbell rang and he knew immediately who was there. 

Remiel: to what do I owe the honor  
Darkasha: I need your help  
Remiel: How may I help Your Majesty  
Darkasha: I need to Excercise a demon  
Remiel: Oh my, you could simply ask Mamon I'm sure he'd send them back  
Darkasha: It's not that simple, I'd like to Banish a Kitsune before she ages into a kyūbi no kitsune 

Remiel: Is this spirit becoming Evil  
Kasha: You and I both know how easily they can be vengeful or deceitful, especially if wronged, and this one has been plenty wronged it's only a matter of time  
Remiel: This may take some research  
Kasha: Thats fine, let me know what you find, and if you could keep this between us, this problem is a bit of an embarrassment.  
Remiel: Ofcourse. 

Will: Where are you headed?  
Caleb: You know where I’m headed.  
Will: You gonna start talking to her again, or should I get ready to bail you out?  
Caleb: Jackie’s pissed, but a restraining order? Come on, man.  
Will gives Caleb a long, assessing look before shrugging. 

Will: Alright, man. I’ll see you later.  
Caleb: Wait, where you going?  
Will: JJ’s got a playdate with Ra’s niece.  
Caleb: My man. 

Caleb walked into the house, his heart pounding in his chest. Today was the day. He was done watching from a distance. He missed his mate and their child terribly, and he couldn't take the separation any longer. As he picked the lock and slipped inside, he heard the soft creak of the back door opening. Without thinking, he rushed toward the sound, catching sight of Jackie stepping out—holding their ....................................... wait that's a is that a yeah, holding their daughter in her arms. 

"She’s… a girl now?" he asked, stopping short.

Jackie turned, her eyes hard and unforgiving. "Yeah. What did you expect, having a kid with a shapeshifter? You got a problem with that?"

Her voice was sharp and challenging. Caleb shook his head quickly. "No, no... I just—can I hold her? Please, Jackie. It’s been so long."

Jackie’s grip on their daughter tightened as she studied him, her expression cold. "So why haven’t you been stalking her?" she asked, her tone dripping with bitterness. She knew. She’d always known.

Caleb’s chest tightened. "I have," he admitted softly. "But my heart... it yearns for both of you." 

Jackie’s eyes narrowed as she stared at him for a long moment, her body tense. Slowly, reluctantly, she held out their daughter. Caleb stepped forward, his hands trembling as he took the baby into his arms. The weight of her, warm and fragile, made his heart ache even more.

“Thank you,” he whispered, his voice breaking. He held their daughter close, trying to absorb the moment, but he could still feel Jackie’s cold gaze on him.

"Don’t think this changes anything,” she said sharply, crossing her arms and stepping back. “You really think showing up here after everything is going to make me forget what you did? How you lied to me from the start?”

Caleb’s heart sank. He thought he could face her, but hearing her say it aloud—laying bare the betrayal—was almost unbearable. 

“Jackie, I know I hurt you,” he said softly, trying to meet her eyes. “But I ended it with her. You and I—those years we spent together—they were real. That wasn’t a lie.”  
Jackie’s laugh was bitter, harsh. “Weren’t they?” She shook her head, her voice breaking as she spoke. “You lied to me from the beginning, Caleb. You swore to me that you didn’t have anyone. I asked you, face to face, and you lied. And then what? You finally break it off with her, and I’m supposed to believe that was enough?”  
She took a step forward, her anger barely contained. “We were happy, sure. But every time I look at you, I can’t forget how we started. How you built our relationship on a lie. Two years, Caleb. Two years of thinking we were perfect, only to find out you had someone else when you came to me.”  
Caleb swallowed hard, the guilt gnawing at him like it always did when they argued about this. He had broken up with his girlfriend long ago, had dedicated himself fully to Jackie, but it didn’t erase the betrayal. He’d lied, and no matter how much time passed, she could never let it go.  
“Jackie, please. You know I ended it because I knew I wanted to be with you,” he said quietly. “I didn’t mean to hurt you. I just—”  
“I broke it off,” he repeated softly. “For you. Because I loved you.”

“And you think that’s supposed to erase the lie?” Jackie’s voice was cold again, but there was a tremor of vulnerability underneath. “I gave you everything, Caleb. I trusted you. And you made me into something I never wanted to be—a second choice, a secret.” 

“I’m sorry,” he whispered, the weight of the apology heavy in his chest. “For everything. For the lie, for what I made you feel. I swear, if I could take it back, I would. But what we had after... that was real, Jackie. You and me. We can still be that again.”

Just then, the front door creaked open, and a woman stepped in—a familiar face. The nanny, always prompt and professional, glanced between them with a slight, knowing frown.

“I’ll take her now,” the nanny said softly, her voice breaking the silence. She gently reached out for the baby, and Caleb reluctantly handed his daughter over to Jackie, brushing his hand across her soft cheek one last time before letting go. The moment felt like more than just giving up his child—it felt like he was losing something else entirely.

As the nanny disappeared with the baby, the distance between him and Jackie felt sharper, more pronounced. He turned back to her, desperation flickering in his eyes. 

“Jackie, please. I’m not that man anymore, haven't been for years” he pleaded, stepping forward. “I know I messed up, but I’ve changed. I’m here, and I want to make this right. I need you. Both of you.”

She crossed her arms tighter, stepping back, her guard still up, her expression unreadable. “You don’t get it, Caleb,” she said, her voice steady but icy. “You think showing up now, saying sorry, is going to erase everything? You think it’s that easy? You lied to me, and you’ve been lurking around here like a ghost for months. You don’t get to come back and pretend like we can just pick up where we left off.”  
“I’m not pretending\!” he shot back, his voice cracking with emotion. “I know I don’t deserve forgiveness overnight, but I’ve been thinking about this every day. I never stopped loving you, Jackie. I never stopped thinking about what we could still be.” 

Jackie’s jaw clenched, her eyes flashing with a mix of hurt and anger. “You had a choice, Caleb. You had a choice back then, and you made it. You lied to me and built us on that lie. I’m not going to be the fool who keeps getting hurt because you suddenly decided to show up and play the hero now.”

Caleb shook his head, his frustration mounting, but there was something more—a resolve in his eyes that hadn’t been there before. He took a step closer, his gaze locked on hers, unyielding. 

“I’m not playing the hero,” he said, his voice firm now. “I’m trying to be the man you deserve. The father she deserves.” He gestured toward the door where their daughter had just been carried out. “And if you’ll let me, I’ll spend the rest of my life proving that to you. That I’m not going anywhere.”

Jackie opened her mouth to retort, but he cut her off, dropping to one knee. The shock in her eyes was immediate, her breath catching as she watched him reach into his pocket.

“Caleb, what are you doing?” she whispered, disbelief and panic mingling in her voice.

He pulled out a small, velvet box and opened it, revealing a ring that caught the dim light between them. His hands were trembling, but his voice was steady. 

“I know I don’t deserve it right now,” he said, looking up at her with raw, unfiltered emotion. “But I want to spend the rest of my life making this right. Marry me, Jackie. Let me prove to you that I’m in this for good. I’ll never lie to you again. I’ll never hurt you again. I just want to be with you—forever.”

Jackie’s breath hitched, her heart pounding as she stared down at him. Every muscle in her body tensed. Part of her wanted to scream at him, to push him away, to tell him this wasn’t enough. But another part, deep down, wanted to believe him, to believe that the man she had loved for so long could really be different.

“But the lie still burns,” she said, her voice shaking with anger, pain, and something else—something that felt like hope, but it was buried under years of resentment. “I don’t even know if I can trust you anymore. How can you stand there and ask me to marry you after everything?”

Caleb’s eyes didn’t waver, his voice barely above a whisper now. “Because I can’t imagine a life without you. And I’m not going to give up until you believe that. I love you, Jackie. I always have.” 

Devina stared at the man in front of her, no not man, Astaroth, the demon, though he was going by "Ash" for the moment. His eyes tracked her every movement, but she was taking her time, enjoying his desperation. The power shift wasn’t lost on her.

“So,” she began with a teasing lilt to her voice, “you’re saying if I sign this contract, I’ll get everything I’ve ever wanted?”  
Astaroth's lips curled into a half-smile, his voice rich and smooth like dark velvet. “Everything, Devina. Power, freedom, pleasure beyond anything you've ever known. All it takes is one little signature. Just a binding agreement between you and me.”  
Devina turned, her eyes sparkling with amusement as she sauntered toward him. “You make it sound so easy. But we both know nothing with you demons is ever that simple.”  
Astaroth took a step closer, his towering figure intimidating yet somehow alluring. “It’s simpler than you think. All I ask for is loyalty—and maybe a little more fun along the way.”  
Her lips curved into a mischievous grin as she gently pushed his hand away, stepping back just out of his reach. “Loyalty? From me? You should know better by now, Ash. I’m not one to be tied down. I like to keep my options open, it's been real fun but, it's been free, I don't like prison.” 

His dark eyes flashed with amusement as he watched her, his tone low and seductive. “That’s what I like about you, Devina. You’re unpredictable, but you know where the real fun lies. And you know, eventually, you’re going to say yes.”  
Devina’s laugh was soft, almost musical, as she slowly lowered herself to her knees in front of him. “Maybe,” she said playfully, glancing up at him through her lashes. “Or maybe I’ll just take what I want without giving you what you want.”  
For a moment, Astaroth’s grin faltered, but his composure returned just as quickly. He wasn’t the type to be easily thrown off. But the sight of her at his feet, willingly placing herself there, was enough to stir a deep satisfaction within him.  
She undid his belt with deliberate slowness, making sure he could feel the intensity of her teasing touch. Her fingers brushed against his skin as she freed him from his clothing, and her eyes never left his. The power dynamic may have appeared to shift, but they both knew the truth—this was her way of playing with fire. 

“You know I don’t do contracts,” she whispered, her lips hovering close to him now, the heat of her breath making him shiver ever so slightly. “But I do enjoy... negotiating.”

Astaroth’s breath caught for a split second as she took him into her mouth, her tongue swirling with practiced skill. His hand moved instinctively to her hair, but he didn’t force her. He let her set the pace, let her have this moment of control. He could play the long game—he always did.

Her mouth moved with deliberate expertise, teasing and tormenting him in equal measure. Astaroth’s head tipped back slightly, his eyes closing as he let the sensation roll through him. But even as he indulged in the pleasure she was giving him, his mind stayed focused. She was playing him, but he knew how to play back. 

“Are you really serious about this, Trin?” Dex finally asked, her voice laced with a mixture of hope and uncertainty. “Using your science expertise to help me and Alejandro have a child?”  
Trin turned, a confident smile lighting up her face as she continued to mix the liquids in a bowl. Her eyes sparkled with excitement. “Absolutely. It should be no problem at all. The process might be a little painful for you, but if you’re willing to bear that pain, it will be worth it. You’ll have his child.”  
Dex took a deep breath, contemplating the weight of her sister's words. The thought of pain made her stomach twist, but the desire for a family outweighed her fears. “What do I have to do? What’s the plan?” 

“I’m going to concoct an elixir—an intricate blend of magic and science that will push both you and Alejandro into a frenzied heat. The magic will heighten your senses and cravings, and seeing you in so much pain will drive him wild. It should be enough to push him over the edge and activate his breeding cycle again.”

Dex’s heart raced at the thought. She couldn’t deny the thrill of what Trin was proposing, even if the method sounded unconventional. “And you’re sure it’ll work?”

Trin nodded, her expression turning serious. “I’ve studied the effects of emotional and physical stimuli on breeding cycles extensively. The combination of heightened desire and a bit of pain can trigger dormant instincts. But you need to trust me, and you need to be prepared for what’s coming. It’ll be intense.” 

“Intense how?” Dex asked, her curiosity piqued despite her nerves.\*

“You’ll experience overwhelming cravings, almost like an addictive high. The pain will come from the elixir pushing your body to its limits, but it’ll also help deepen your bond with Alejandro. You’ll both feel it.” \* meeting her sister’s gaze.\* “But you have to promise me—no backing out. Once we start, there’s no turning back.”

Dex swallowed hard, weighing the risks against her dreams. The thought of holding a child of her own, a piece of Alejandro and herself, made her heart flutter. “I promise. I’ll do whatever it takes.”

Trin grinned, her excitement palpable. “Great\! Now, let’s get started. First, we need to prepare the base for the elixir. You’ll need to be fully ready when the time comes, tell your hubby to meet me in my lab.” 

When she reached her lab, the sterile space was illuminated by the glow of several machines and bubbling cauldrons. The faint hum of machinery filled the air, mixing with the rich scent of herbs and the metallic tang of various chemicals. She took a moment to collect her thoughts before Alejandro arrived. He always had a way of grounding her, even when the stakes were high. Just then, the door swung open, and Alejandro stepped in, his handsome features illuminated by the fluorescent lights. His brow furrowed with concern as he took in the sight of her bustling around the lab.  
 “Trin, what’s going on? Dex said you needed to talk to me about something important.”  
“Hey, Ale,” she greeted, forcing a smile despite the tension in the air. “I’m glad you’re here. We need to discuss the plan for Dex.”

As she moved from machine to machine, Alejandro followed, his eyes scanning the various equi.ent and potions lined up on the counters. “What kind of plan? Is she okay?” 

Trin paused, turning to face him, her expression serious. “She’s going to be okay, but it’s going to be intense. We’re going to create an elixir that will push both of you into a frenzied heat. Dex is going to experience some pain during the process, but it’s crucial for activating your breeding cycle.”\*

Alejandro’s eyes widened slightly, the weight of her words sinking in. “Pain? Is that really necessary?”

“Yes,” Trin said, moving closer to him, her tone soothing. “Trust me, Ale. The pain will serve a purpose. It’ll heighten her cravings for you, and seeing her like that will push you over the edge. You’ll know instinctively when to embrace her. Your instincts will guide you; just trust in that.” 

The tension in his shoulders was evident as he absorbed her explanation. “And what if I can’t handle it? What if it’s too much for both of us?”  
Trin Zipped around still creating but understanding his worry and feeling for this man who had come to love her baby sister so much, meeting his gaze firmly. “You’re stronger than you think, Alejandro. You both are. Just remember that this is all part of the process. The elixir will amplify your bond, and the pain Dex experiences will only strengthen your connection. It’ll be worth it, I promise.”\*

He took a deep breath, searching her eyes for reassurance. Finally, he nodded, though doubt still flickered in his gaze. “Alright. I trust you. I just want her to be safe.”\* 

“And she will be,” Trin promised, moving back to her work station. “Now, help me with this. We need to prepare the base, and then we can get ready for her  I doubt you here this a lot but I'm gonna need some blood.” 

Dex stood in the dim light of the room, her heart thudding in her chest as she thought about what was coming. The anticipation of the ritual and the pain Trin had warned her about weighed heavily on her, but it was nothing compared to her desire to finally have a child with Alejandro. She glanced toward the doorway as she heard his footsteps approaching, his tall frame casting a shadow across the room.

Alejandro stepped in, his expression a mixture of concern and tenderness as he closed the door behind him. He crossed the room slowly, his dark eyes locked on Dex as if she were the center of his universe.

“Dex...” he whispered, his voice heavy with emotion.

She looked up at him, her heart aching with both love and nervousness. “Ale...”

He sighed, his breath mingling with hers. “I’m worried for you. Trin told me how painful this could be. The thought of you going through that—it kills me inside.” 

His grip tightened on her, the intensity of his emotions clear in his voice. “And I’ll be by your side through it all. No matter what happens, I won’t leave you. Ever. You’ll never go through this alone. I’ll be there with you, every step of the way.”

She could see the worry etched in his features, but his love for her shone even brighter. Tears welled in her eyes as she rested her head against his chest, listening to the steady beat of his heart. “I’m scared too, but I trust you. I trust us.”

Alejandro’s hand moved to the back of her head, gently stroking her hair as he pressed a kiss to her temple. “You’re so brave, Dex. I love you more than anything in this world. Whatever comes next, we’ll face it together. You and me, forever.”

Dex pulled back just enough to look into his eyes, her heart swelling at the depth of his words. She reached up, pressing a soft kiss to his lips. “I love you too, Ale. More than words can say.”

For a moment, they stood there, wrapped in each other’s arms, finding solace in their shared love and commitment. Despite the uncertainty of what lay ahead, they knew they would face it together, side by side, as they always had. 

Will stood outside the small café, his heart heavy with nerves. This was his first time seeing Elly since she left, and the months apart had been hard. He hadn’t known what to expect, but when she walked in, it wasn’t the broken woman who had left him that he saw. Elly looked amazing—he almost didn't recognize her, the skin was glowing, her eyes were clear, her hair, and her body language calm in a way that startled him. She had clearly gotten help and looked far better than when she had been trapped in the storm of postpartum depression.

For a moment, Will couldn’t speak. Elly had been a shell of herself when she left, using drugs to cope, but now... now she was a different person.

“Elly,” he said quietly, trying to find his footing. She gave no smile, though her eyes flicked away quickly as if unsure how to respond. It wasn’t hostility—it was more like a cautious peace. 

She glanced past him, her eyes softening as they landed on JJ, who was playing quietly with a small toy truck near Will’s legs.

“Hey, little man,” she said softly, crouching down and reaching out as JJ looked up at her, studying her face. Will watched as their son seemed to recognize her, a small smile spreading across his chubby cheeks before he toddled over.

For a brief moment, everything seemed almost normal. But the tension returned when Lyxra walked by, holding her niece’s hand, not expecting the confrontation she was about to walk into. Will felt his stomach clench. He hadn’t told Elly about Lyxra they had only just reconnected, not wanting to complicate things further. 

Elly’s eyes flicked from Lyxra to Will, a forced smile on her lips, masking the surge of jealousy she couldn’t hide. “I see you brought company,” she said, her tone sharp enough to cut through the air. She stood up, brushing imaginary dust from her dress as if to shake off the moment.  
Will shifted uncomfortably, glancing at Lyxra, who caught the tension but stood her ground, her calm demeanor a contrast to Elly’s simmering emotions.  
“Elly, this is Lyxra, my—”  
“Girlfriend, yeah, I figured,” Elly interrupted, her voice clipped. She glanced at Lyxra with a scrutinizing look. “So, how long have you two been...?” She trailed off, probing, her gaze sharp and unrelenting. 

Lyxra’s expression didn’t waver, and she met Elly’s stare with quiet confidence. “Long enough,” she said coolly, refusing to back down. There was no hint of insecurity in her voice.

Elly’s jaw tightened, and for a moment, Will could feel the heat rising between them. He hated this—hated feeling trapped between the two women in his life. He just wanted to keep the peace for JJ’s sake.

“I’m sure you’ve got everything figured out,” Elly said with a bitter laugh, crossing her arms. Her gaze swept over Lyxra again before shifting back to Will, the jealousy burning in her eyes now unmistakable.\* 

Lyxra’s smile was small but confident, clearly catching the shift in the air. "I didn’t mean to interrupt. Just happened to be nearby."  
Elly gave a tight smile, brushing her fingers over her coat as if it would ground her. "Oh, no worries. You’re not interrupting," she said, voice overly sweet. She leaned her head and stared at Lyxra as if the angle would help her see something unseen.  
"Taking things slow," Elly echoed, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "That’s good. Wouldn’t want to rush into anything... especially when there’s a kid involved." Her gaze was pointed as she subtly reminded everyone of her role as the mother. 

Two Kids The in Audible Bitch was extremely Loud.  
Lyxra didn’t flinch, her expression steady as she met Elly’s stare. "Will’s a good father. And I’ve grown pretty fond of JJ myself."  
The air between them thickened, the words laced with challenge. Will shifted uncomfortably, stepping forward slightly. "Let’s... not do this, alright? We’re all here for JJ." 

"I wasn't aware that was your child." Elly simply responded  
"My niece." Lyxra quickly answered back "Riiiggghhhhttttt cause that's the same." Will sensing the atmosphere getting heavier by the moment and desperate to get a moment of peace chimed in with "It's kind of cold out here for the kids maybe we should go inside and warm up." 

"Does your babysitter have to come? She had nothing to be worried about Wilfred I wasn't coming to whisk you away from her she could have stayed at home."  
Lyxra, calm as ever, tilted her head slightly, her eyes never leaving Elly’s. "I’m not going anywhere either, Elly. We both care about JJ, and that’s what matters. You may not like me, but I’m here to stay."  
"Whatever you say, little Vampire, come on hypocrite lets go." 

Lyxra shifted beside him, her calm demeanor faltering for a brief moment as she glanced at Will, waiting to see what he’d say. But Elly, still holding JJ, pressed her lips to his forehead. "Whose Mommies sweet, sweet baby." Elly cooed and played with her little one, JJ Glorified by the attention his mother showered him with. 

“I’ll be back to see him again soon,” she said, her voice suddenly more resolute as she turned her back to Will and Lyxra. “And next time, I’ll be taking him with me. He should spend more time with his mother.”

Will’s heart skipped a beat, an instinctive objection rising in his throat. “Elly, I don’t know if that’s—”

She spun around, her eyes blazing as she interrupted him. “Why? Because you’ve got a new life now? A new bitch? Go ahead and have another baby with her\!” Her voice cracked as she spat the words, her anger and pain seeping through her cool exterior. “Because thanks to carrying your pup, I can’t have any more. My body’s broken. But don’t worry about that, right? You’ve already moved on. 

Will’s breath caught in his chest as the weight of her words hit him like a freight train. He wanted to say something, to tell her that it wasn’t like that, but the words got stuck in his throat. Lyxra shifted uncomfortably but didn’t speak, giving them space.  
Elly took a deep breath, pressing her lips to JJ’s head once more before putting him back to walk. She didn’t say another word as she turned on her heel and walked away, her shoulders stiff as she disappeared out the door.  
The silence that followed was thick, and Will could feel Lyxra’s eyes on him, waiting for him to say something. But for now, all he could do was smile and panic, his mind spinning as the gravity of the encounter settled over him. 

For the next few days, Ale ensured they were ready. It wasn’t hard to be physically ready; it was more nervous than anything. Ale was wondering if Dex was more worried than she should be. After returning home from his last day of work before his next few days off, he opened the door and was hit with this sickeningly sweet smell that made his mouth water. It was just left when he’d first seen Dex all those months ago. It was eerily quiet as he called out to Dex and heard muffled whines in response. Ale opened the door and felt the blood boil at the sight of her. She looked like she was in pain. Her body was trembling as if she was fighting herself and failing. He reached out to her, his voice no louder than a whisper, “Dex?” 

At the sound of Ale's gentle voice, Dex's eyes fluttered open, falling backward unable to keep focusing on him, eyes glazed with a mix of desperation and pleading. She whimpered again, struggling against the overwhelming urge coursing through her veins. "Ale..." she choked out, her voice strained and barely audible. "Please..." Her body continued to tremble violently, the sweet, cloying scent surrounding them intensifying with each passing moment. Clearly, she was fighting a losing battle against her impending heat, her werewolf nature taking control. 

As I fought my body for control, looking up at Ale as my pupils dilated, focusing in on his mouth, listening to his breath as all the sounds around me began to blend. Ale could sense the wildness rising within Dex, her body tensing and relaxing sporadically as she battled against the shift. He tried to calm her, murmuring soothing words even as he recognized the futility of trying to reason with her in this state,Trin said I would know when but seeing her like this is only making me feel guilty, bending and picking her up. 

He buried his face in her neck, breathing in her unique scent as he sought to ground her and offer her comfort.\* "There, there, my love," Dex shivered as Ale held her close, trying to find peace in his presence. The throbbing between her legs was unbearable, and she couldn't stop squirming as she tried to seek some level of relief. "It hurts," \*I whimpered, burying my face in his shoulder as she struggled to 

Keeping one arm securely around her waist, Ale slid the other hand down to cup Dex's mound through her clothing. He rubbed slow, deliberate circles over the sensitive area, applying enough pressure to provide some relief without pushing her too far. "That's it, relax and let me take care of you," Ale coaxed, his voice low and hypnotic. The moment Ale touched me, I let out a high-pitched whine, arching my back as I tried to grind against his hand. My hips bucked erratically, seeking friction, but it wasn't enough; I was dripping with need. "Dex\!" Ale's sharp reprimand cut through the haze of my lust, and I froze, panting heavily as I stared up at him with glazed eyes. "Focus on me, not the beast inside you." 

My gaze dropped to his lips, and I licked mine, tasting the faint saltiness of sweat. The urge to bite, to claim, was overwhelming, but I forced myself to obey Ale's command, meeting his eyes instead. Ale's stern tone had the desired effect, Dex's frantic movements slowing as she refocused on him. He kept his hand firmly planted on her mound, continuing to stroke her through the fabric, providing a steady source of stimulation to help manage her arousal. "Look at me, my love," he instructed, his voice firm but gentle. "I want to see those beautiful eyes, not the animalistic hunger clouding them." 

As she complied, Ale's desire surged, his cock twitching in response to her desperate panting and the way her breasts heaved with each ragged breath. He ached to taste her, to sink his teeth into her tender flesh and mark her as his, but he restrained himself, knowing it would only exacerbate her condition. "You're doing so well, Dex," Ale praised, his thumb rubbing small circles over her clit. " My breath hitched as Ale's praise washed over me, the gentle praise helping to calm the raging storm inside me. I bit my lip, trying to hold back the moans building in my throat as his skilled fingers worked their magic. 

Ale's grip tightened around Dex as she convulsed in his arms, her cries of ecstasy music to his ears. He continued to stroke her through the climax, coaxing out every last tremor until she collapsed against him, spent and panting. "That's it, my love," he murmured, nuzzling her hair as he held her close. "Let it all out. I've got you." Once the aftershocks subsided, Ale carefully guided Dex to lay backward, the scent of her, the sound of her, the feel of her, it had unlocked something Primal in him long sealed away and he was hungry. 

"Beautiful," Ale breathed, his eyes drinking in the sight of her glistening folds. "So perfect and responsive to my touch." I shuddered as the cool air hit my heated skin, my oversensitive fleshtingling with renewed awareness. The sight of Ale kneeling before me, his dark eyes filled with unbridled desire, sent another surge of wetness gushing from my core, That's when he began to feast. 

"P-Please, Ale," I begged, my voice a needy whimper. "I need you inside me. I can't wait anymore\!" I spread my legs wider, offering myself to him completely. My Body was Coming undone, I was being swallowed up and I could barely find my voice, but when I finally did I screamed. Fuck me, fuck me hard\!" I pleaded, my hands fisting in the sheets beside me. "Fill me up and fuck me senseless\!" 

I moaned loudly, throwing my head back as I rode Ale's face, faster, chasing my impending release. My nails dug into the walls, leaving crescent-shaped indents in them as I used his tongue for my pleasure. "Mine, you’re mine\!" I chanted, my hips undulating wildly. " I need  you to Fuck me like you hate me\!" The pressure inside me reached a fever pitch, my walls fluttering erratically around Ale's tongue and fingers as he played a wild melody, using me as his instrument. 

Ale's eyes flashed crimson at Dex's filthy words, a primal growl rumbling in his chest. He grabbed her hips, slamming her down onto his cock with bruising force as he pistoned up into her. "Take it, you little minx," he snarled, his voice rough with lust. "This is what you wanted, isn't it? To be fucked like a bitch in heat?" One hand moved to her throat, applying just enough pressure to make her lightheaded. The other slid around her waist to turn her around, hearing her whimper from his brief removal. "Come for me, Dex," Ale commanded, his thrusts becoming erratic as his climax approached. "Scream my name and come all over my cock\!" I screamed as Ale's fingers found my clit, rubbing the sensitive bundle of nerves with ruthless precision. My body tensed, then snapped taut as a third, even more intense orgasm ripped through me. "ALE\! OH FUCK, ALE\!" I howled, my pussy clamping down on him like a vice as I came undone. "YES, YES, FILL ME UP\!" He increased the tempo, his balls slapping against her ass with each powerful stroke. The coil of tension in his abdomen wound tighter, signaling his imminent release. Intense pleasure coursed through me as Ale's teeth sank into my neck, the slight pain mixing with the overwhelming bliss of his cock driving into me relentlessly. I could feel my second orgasm building, the pressure coiling tighter and tighter in my core. 

"Mine," he snarled possessively, sinking his teeth into the tender flesh of her neck. He sucked hard, marking her as his own as he continued to pound into her willing body. "So fucking perfect," Ale groaned, his voice muffled against her skin. "Your heat, scent, everything about you drives me wild." He increased the tempo, his balls slapping against her ass with each powerful stroke. The coil of tension in his abdomen wound tighter, signaling his imminent release. Intense pleasure coursed through me as Ale's teeth sank into my neck, the slight pain mixing with the overwhelming bliss of his cock driving into me relentlessly. I could feel my second orgasm building, the pressure coiling tighter and tighter in my core. My vision went white as the pleasure consumed me, waves of ecstasy crashing over me in relentless succession. Through it all, Ale's cock remained buried deep inside me, his release pulsing hot and heavy against my cervix. With a final, savage thrust, Ale buried himself to the hilt inside Dex, his cock erupting like a geyser. Thick ropes of cum painted her insides, marking her as his once more. "Fuck, yes\!" he roared, his hips jerking erratically as he emptied his balls deep within her fertile womb. "Take it all, my love\!""You are incredible," he murmured, pressing a tender kiss to her temple. "I never knew mating could be this intense." 

* This must be the so-called "honeymoon stage." Trinity thought, though they had been home for well over two weeks, their coupling did not slow. Their passion ignited, and their bodies were entwined on the sofa, lost in a world of their own. Lips met in fervent kisses, hands roaming with desperate hunger. Yuval's fingertips danced across Trinity's chest, tracing the contours of her breasts with deliberate slowness. Each touch sent ripples of pleasure coursing through her veins, her nipples hardening into pert peaks beneath his caress. His palms slid lower, skimming over the gentle swell of her hips to grasp her thighs, parting them invitingly as he settled between her legs. The air was heavy with the scent of their mingled arousal, musky and intoxicating. Trinity's ragged breaths mingled with Yuval's in a symphony of lustful anticipation. (edited)  
*   
* Suddenly, a knock at the door shattered the intimate moment. They froze, hearts pounding in unison. Who could that be? she whispered, her breath hot against his neck. He pulled away slightly, meeting her wide-eyed gaze. Another knock, more insistent this time. In a panic, she gripped him tighter, pulling him flush against her. He gasped, burying his face into her breast to muffle his groan. "whoever it was would just have to go away." Were Yuvals thoughts as he gently sucked the nipple in his mouth, then he saw the intruder walking around the side of the house to the glass door. "FUCK." (edited)  
*   
* "Why is she here?" *Trin barely processed his words before she turned to see her sister inlaw at the door. The doorknob turned, and footsteps approached.* (edited)  
*   
* *The front door creaked open, shattering the sensual silence. Trinity froze, her body taut as a bowstring, every nerve ending screaming to ignore the unwanted presence. But duty called, and with a deep sigh, she reluctantly disengaged from Yuval's embrace, reaching for the Jacket that was hung nearby she quickly covered herself, Yuval snuck away while his bride was distractedly dressing herself.* (edited)  
*   
* Elly\!\!\! Hey.” Trinity did her best to sound enthusiastic, though she hadn’t expected the interruption. The honeymoon phase had her spellbound, and she was becoming almost addicted to it. With Yuval, every touch felt new, a sweetness she couldn’t get enough of. She smiled, shifting slightly to hide the dreamy haze she was still in, but Elly was perceptive. “Caught you two getting NASTY, didn’t I?” Elly teased her voice light but with a knowing edge. Trinity laughed, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. “Maybe a little,” Trinity admitted, feeling warmth rush to her cheeks. “It’s just…this whole honeymoon thing. I didn’t realize how…intoxicating it could be.” She tried to suppress the grin that tugged at her lips but failed. The memories of Yuval's hands tracing her skin, their laughter, and the closeness were like an ever-present hum under her skin. (edited)  
*   
* Elly raised a brow, a soft smirk playing on her lips. “Well, I’ll make this quick, then, before I ruin any more Woohoo time. But you do look different—happy.” Elly’s expression softened, and for a moment, they shared a genuine connection. “Thanks, Elly. I really am,” Trinity said, meeting her sister-in-law’s eyes with sincerity. Though the interruption had pulled her away, the warmth of Yuval’s presence still lingered, and even now, her thoughts drifted, only half-attentive. Trinity laughed, giving her sister-in-law a light nudge. “I guess I can forgive you…this time. But don’t forget, Yuval and I are moving tomorrow, so you’ll have all the quiet you want soon enough\!” Elly rolled her eyes, feigning offense. “Ah, trying to get rid of me, I see\! But fine, I’ll take my cue and let you get back to your newlywed bliss. Though don’t think this means you’ll get rid of me that easily,” she teased, backing toward the door. “I’d never think that,” Trinity replied with a grin. “Though I am counting down the hours until tomorrow\!” With a playful wave, Elly slipped out, leaving Trinity to sink back into the warmth of her thoughts, the upcoming move with Yuval adding an extra thrill to her happiness.

* Nastier: Hey, stranger. It’s been a while. Elly: Yeah, I know. Trying to keep my distance. Nastier: Well, that’s one way to say you missed me. We were friends once, Elly. Elly: “Friends” might be a stretch. But you were…there, I’ll give you that. Nastier: So cold. Look, if you won’t come by, that’s fine. But I thought maybe you’d want to catch up. Elly: Nastier. Just been busy…new life and all. Nastier: Busy avoiding me, more like. Thought we were tighter than that. Elly: It’s just better if I keep my distance. You know that. Nastier: Better for who? C’mon, you act like we didn’t look out for each other once. We had some good times. Elly: We had “times,” I’ll give you that. Nastier: Wow, harsh. I’m just saying, you could drop by. Nobody’s twisting your arm here. Elly: Why would I even come by? There’s nothing there for me anymore. (edited)  
*   
* Elly: Why would I even come by? There’s nothing there for me anymore. Nastier: There’s me. Or did I stop counting? You know I wouldn’t ask if I didn’t mean it. Elly ...Fine. But I’m just saying hi and leaving. Nothing more. Nastier: Deal. Just come by. *When Elly arrives, she finds Tony instead of Nastier, with a note of surprise.* Elly: So much for that “nobody’s twisting your arm.” You’re not even here. Nastier: Relax. I’ll be there soon. Meantime, Tony’s there to keep you company. He’s Always been good to you. Elly: I know, I don’t have patience for much more these days. Nastier: Give him a chance, yeah? You might surprise yourself (edited)  
*   
* “Hey, Elly,” Tony said, flashing her a grin that almost made up for the mess. “Nastier stepped out for a sec. Thought he’d be back by now.” She sighed, crossing her arms. “Figures. And there’s nowhere to sit in here,” she muttered, eyeing the mess. “Oh, right. Well, you can sit in my room if you want—it’s, uh, cleaner,” he offered, looking a little sheepish. Hesitantly, she followed him to the back. His room was small but surprisingly neat compared to the rest of the house. She sat on the edge of the bed, feeling a bit out of place, and took a moment to look Tony over. When had he gotten so grown up? His shoulders were broad, his arms strong and muscular, and his face…was he always this handsome? “Nice room,” she managed, hoping to break the awkward silence. (edited)  
    
* “Thanks. I, uh, cleaned up a bit,” Tony replied, rubbing the back of his neck, clearly picking up on the tension between them. He sat across from her in a chair, his gaze steady. Elly tried to ignore the unexpected attraction fluttering up. “So…how’ve you been, Tony?” she asked, the question feeling almost absurd given the setting. He chuckled, his eyes lighting up. “Better, actually. Got some good people looking out for me.” He paused, then glanced at her. “But enough about me…how are you doing, Elly?” The question lingered between them, and for a moment, she felt a little more seen than she’d expected. (edited)  
*   
* Tony leaned in, his gaze fixed on Elly with a hint of admiration and nostalgia. He noticed the changes right away—she looked healthier, clearer, like a weight had finally lifted. “You look…good, Elly. I mean, I can tell. You’ve gotten clean.” His voice was soft, proud. She smiled faintly, a little self-conscious. “Yeah, I have. Took a lot, but I’m finally getting my life back together.” He nodded, his eyes never leaving her face, as if he was piecing together the time they’d lost. “Missed you, though,” he said, almost under his breath. *What was this young boy doing? Elly almost jumped out of her skin with shock as he began to caress her face.* (edited)  
*   
* She paused, his words lingering between them. “Thanks, Tony. It…it means a lot. Getting clean, it didn’t come easy, you know? Had to leave a lot behind…including my husband.” She hesitated, then continued, “It hurt like hell. I saw him with his new woman, too. A whole fresh start for him. Meanwhile, I’m just…relearning how to stand on my own.” Tony listened, his eyes locked onto hers, filled with something close to admiration. “I bet it wasn’t easy,” he said, voice low. “But you did it. And that’s…that’s something else, Elly.” Elly smiled, the warmth in his gaze catching her a little off guard. “Thank you, Tony,” she murmured, her cheeks heating under his unbroken attention. She couldn’t remember the last time someone had looked at her quite like this. (edited)  
*   
* Tony reached out, his fingers brushing softly against her cheek. The touch was warm, grounding, and yet there was a tenderness in it that sent a flutter through her chest. His hand lingered, as if he couldn’t bring himself to pull away. “Elly…” he started, his voice barely above a whisper. “I know this is…a lot, and maybe the timing’s all wrong, but…you have no idea how much I admire you.” His thumb traced a gentle line down her cheek. “I’ve always cared about you. I mean, you looked out for me in ways no one else ever did.” (edited)  
*   
* Her breath caught as he continued, his gaze fixed on her with a depth she hadn’t seen in him before. “I missed you,” he confessed, his voice filled with a vulnerability that surprised her. “Missed how you’d just…show up and make this place feel like home. Remember when you used to cook for me? You didn’t have to do that, but you did. No one’s done that for me since.” A soft smile crossed her lips, memories of those simpler moments flooding back. “Yeah, I remember,” she whispered, her hand instinctively reaching up to cover his. (edited)  
*   
* The soft light of the evening sun filtered through the curtains, casting a warm glow in the room as Tony and Elly sat side by side on the edge of the bed. The atmosphere was thick with unspoken words, their hearts beating in a syncopated rhythm of hope and hesitation. Tony turned to Elly, his gaze earnest and searching. “You know, ever since you left, I’ve felt this emptiness. I thought I could just push it away, but I can’t.” He reached out, gently brushing a strand of hair behind her ear, his fingers lingering on her cheek. “I miss you, Elly. I miss us.” (edited)  
*   
* Elly’s breath caught in her throat as his thumb traced her jawline, igniting a familiar warmth within her. She looked down, feeling a mix of vulnerability and desire. “I’ve missed you too, Tony. More than I care to admit. After everything, I was so scared to reach out. I thought if I did I would fall into the same cycle of abuse again.” “Never too late,” he whispered, his voice low and comforting. He leaned closer, their foreheads almost touching, and she could feel the heat radiating from him. “I want to be here for you. I want to make this work if you’ll let me.” His words hung in the air, laden with meaning. Elly finally met his gaze, searching for sincerity, and found it. There was a flicker of hope in her heart, sparking a long-buried yearning. She moved a little closer, the space between them shrinking, her heart racing. Tony shifted slightly, his hand moving to Gently stroke her cheek and chin enjoying the feel of her soft skin in his hands. “You deserve someone who’s going to be there for you, through everything. I want to be that person.” (edited)  
*   
* \*Feeling a Daring and a resolve to live her life to the fullest Elly climbed on Antonio, closing the distance completely, their lips brushing softly in a tentative kiss. It was sweet, almost hesitant at first, but it quickly deepened as Tony cupped her face, drawing her closer. As the kiss lingered, the world outside faded away, leaving just the two of them in their own little bubble. Elly felt a rush of emotions—relief, joy, and the thrill of something new awakening between them. their breaths mingling as they caught their breath. “How about we take this one step at a time?” he murmured, his eyes sparkling with affection. Elly nodded, her heart racing. “I’d like that,” she replied, a shy smile breaking across her face. They both leaned in again, sharing another kiss, this one deeper, filled with promise and unspoken desire. (edited)  
*   
  As the weight of their emotions hung in the air, Tony’s desire surged to the surface, igniting a fire within him that he could no longer contain. He moved swiftly, his hands finding the hem of Elly’s shirt, lifting it over her head and tossing it aside. The sight of her revealed skin took his breath away, and he couldn’t resist the urge to touch. Elly gasped, feeling exposed yet electrified by his boldness. There was a moment of surprise in her eyes, but the heat of the moment quickly overcame her hesitation. She felt a rush of exhilaration as Tony leaned in closer, his breath warm against her skin. “Are you sure?” he murmured, his voice thick with desire, searching her eyes for any sign of doubt. “More than ever,” she breathed, the weight of his gaze making her pulse race. With that silent agreement, Tony’s hands moved with a mix of tenderness and urgency. He disrobed her further, his fingers gliding down her sides, savoring the softness of her skin beneath his touch. Elly’s heart raced, a mix of thrill and anticipation flooding her senses. In one fluid motion, he guided her to straddle his face, the world around them fading into a blur of sensations. Elly felt a rush of heat as she settled into place, a mix of vulnerability and empowerment coursing through her.

* As he engaged with her, his mouth and tongue moving with a skilled urgency, Elly gasped, the sensation igniting a fire deep within her. Every stroke sent waves of pleasure coursing through her, pulling her deeper into the moment. Overcome by the intensity of the experience, she couldn’t help but arch her back, surrendering to the ecstasy he was bringing her. “Tony…” she gasped, her voice a breathy whisper filled with longing, her hands finding his hair, fingers tangling in the soft strands as she rode the waves of sensation. She was taken aback by how quickly they had crossed this threshold, yet it felt right—electric and alive. His hands gripped her hips, guiding her movements, urging her to let go of any lingering doubts. With each moment, she felt more connected to him, more in tune with the rhythm of their bodies. The world outside faded entirely, leaving only the two of them entwined in a dance of passion. Elly leaned forward, her body instinctively responding to his touch, and she met his gaze, her eyes filled with a mix of desire and vulnerability. “I want you,” she whispered, her breath hitching with anticipation, igniting a primal instinct in him. With a deep, hungry kiss, they both surrendered to the moment, lost in the whirlwind of their rekindled love and lust. With a surge of desire coursing through him, Tony shifted beneath her, his hands gripping her waist as he gently guided her down. The world outside faded even further as he slid her down onto him, their bodies coming together in a beautiful, intimate union. (edited)

* Elly gasped at the sensation, a wave of warmth enveloping her as she felt the weight of him beneath her. Every nerve ending ignited as she pressed against him, their skin meeting in a rush of heat and connection. The intensity of the moment made her heart race, a mix of exhilaration and longing swelling within her. “Are you okay?” he asked, his voice low, his eyes searching hers for reassurance. “Yes,” she breathed, a soft smile spreading across her face as she met his gaze. “More than okay.” The lust in her voice ignited something primal within him. As Elly settled onto him, Tony’s hands explored her body, tracing the curves he had longed to touch. He cupped her face, leaning in for a deep kiss that sent shivers down her spine. Their mouths moved together in a passionate dance, each kiss igniting the fire between them even further. Feeling the heat radiate from their bodies, Elly instinctively began to move, her hips grinding against him as she found a rhythm that felt intoxicating. Each subtle shift of her body sent waves of pleasure coursing through them both, making her moan softly into his mouth. Tony responded instinctively, his hands gripping her hips tighter, guiding her movements as he pushed upward to meet her. The sensation was overwhelming, a perfect blend of tenderness and raw desire that left them both breathless. “Elly…” he murmured against her lips, the sound heavy with need. The intimacy of the moment washed over them like a tidal wave, washing away any remnants of hesitation. Elly felt alive, cherished, and desired in a way she hadn’t experienced in so long. She leaned down, capturing his lips again, pouring all of her longing and affection into that kiss. Their bodies moved together in perfect harmony, the boundaries between them fading as they surrendered completely to the moment. Each thrust and movement heightened their connection, binding them together in a way that felt both exhilarating and sacred. As they lost themselves in each other, Elly felt a sense of peace and belonging wash over her, the warmth of Tony’s body a perfect sanctuary from the world outside. In this space, nothing else mattered—just the two of them, entwined in their passion and love

* *Dex sat at the table, staring down at her breakfast, her fork hovering over the scrambled eggs she’d barely touched. Her stomach churned, and it wasn’t just morning queasiness—it was the excitement that had bubbled up inside her ever since she’d seen the positive pregnancy test. She still couldn’t believe it. She and Ale were going to have a baby. A giddy smile tugged at her lips, and she quickly covered her mouth, as if her excitement might somehow burst out and spoil the moment. The reality of it hadn’t fully sunk in, but her body seemed to know something her mind was still wrapping itself around.* (edited)

  *She felt queasy, her senses heightened in a strange, almost magical way. The smell of the coffee on the table suddenly seemed too strong, the texture of the eggs strange, and the hum of the refrigerator oddly loud. After a few unsuccessful attempts to take another bite, Dex sighed, pushing the plate away. Her heart was beating fast. She felt like she was carrying the best secret in the world, but now, she couldn’t keep it to herself much longer. Standing up, she picked up her plate and made her way to the sink, intending to scrape the uneaten food into the trash. Her hands were shaking slightly, and she couldn’t help but let out a small, breathy laugh. She was going to be a mother\! The word felt so big, so impossible and yet so perfect.* (edited)

* *Just as she was finishing with the plate, Ale walked into the kitchen, grinning as usual, bringing a wave of his familiar, comforting scent. But this time, Dex’s stomach twisted. Her newly heightened pregnancy senses kicked in, and his cologne—usually something she adored—now felt like an assault on her nose.* “Morning, love,” *Ale said, stretching and moving toward her with that easy, warm smile she loved so much. Dex’s eyes watered involuntarily as he got closer, and she tried not to recoil. She felt a pang of guilt because she loved his scent, but right now, it was too much. She cleared her throat, turning away slightly.* “Um… morning, Ale,” *she replied, a shy smile playing on her lips, despite her nose wrinkling. She took a deep breath, trying to center herself. This was the moment. She couldn’t hold it in any longer.* (edited)

* “Ale,” *she started, her voice wavering with barely contained excitement. She could feel the words bubbling up, her heart pounding in her chest. “I… I have something to tell you.” \*\*Ale’s brow furrowed with a gentle curiosity.* “Did,.....did it work?” *he asked, stepping closer, his eyes bright and eager. Dex swallowed, taking in a steadying breath.* “Yup we’re… having a baby,” *she whispered, her voice breaking on the last word as her emotions overflowed. The joy, the nervousness, and the disbelief all mingled together, making her cheeks flush. Ale’s face lit up, his eyes wide with delight.* “We’re… wait, really?” *he asked, his grin growing.* “We’re having a baby?” (edited)

* *Dex nodded, biting her lip as she fought back happy tears.* “Yes. We’re going to be parents.” *Without a moment’s hesitation, Ale stepped forward, wrapping his arms around her, leaning in for a celebratory kiss. But Dex’s stomach twisted violently, and she instinctively pushed him back, her hands on his chest.* (edited)

* *Ale stopped, looking down at her in surprise, and she felt heat rising in her cheeks.* “I’m sorry\!” *she blurted out, laughing nervously.* “It’s just… you smell so… strong today. My nose… I don’t know what’s going on with it. I think it’s the pregnancy.” *Ale let out a low, amused chuckle.* “Hey, it’s okay,” *he said, his laughter warm and understanding. He took a step back, holding up his hands in surrender.* “I guess I’ll have to tone down the cologne, huh?” (edited)

* *She laughed, relieved by his easygoing response.* “Please do,” *she teased, pressing a hand over her nose and breathing through her mouth, fighting to keep her breakfast down.* “I just… I never thought this would happen. We’re really having a baby\!” *Ale reached out, brushing his hand against her cheek, his gaze tender and filled with awe.* “You have no idea how happy you’ve made me,” *he murmured, his eyes glistening with tears he couldn't shed.* “I love you so much, Dex. And I already love our baby more than I can say.” *Testing his luck he tried to move in for another kiss.* "Nope, no, sorry I got carried away." (edited)

* *Dex’s heart swelled, and she wanted nothing more than to close the distance between them. She steeled herself, taking a deep breath and trying to ignore the lingering scent that had overwhelmed her senses. She looked up at him, her eyes shimmering with joy, and said,* “Okay, I think I can handle one kiss. Just… let me hold my breath.” *Ale chuckled, and Dex grinned* (edited)

* *Closing her eyes, holding her breath, and leaning up to press her lips against his. She could feel the warmth of his love in that gentle kiss, the excitement they both shared radiating between them. When she finally pulled back, a little breathless, she laughed, wiping at a stray tear that had slipped down her cheek.* “Looks like we’re in for an adventure,” *Ale said, pulling her close in a careful hug, his voice a low murmur by her ear.* “You, me, and the little one.” (edited)

* *The air was thick with the lingering heat of their recent love-making, Dex was amazed at how sickness gave way to insatiable lust, their skin warm and slick as they lay together, catching their breath, still lost in the blissful afterglow. Ale’s fingers lazily traced circles on her back, his gaze drifting to the ceiling, lost in thought. Finally, he broke the silence, a gentle smile tugging at the corners of his lips.* “So… what do you think it’ll be? A boy or a girl?” *he asked softly, his voice low and filled with wonder. Dex chuckled, the sound soft and musical,* “I don’t know. I think I could see a little girl with your eyes and mischievous smile,” *she murmured, her words tender. She tilted her head up to look at him, her own eyes sparkling with excitement.* “But maybe we’ll end up with a little boy who takes after you in every way.” *Ale laughed, his arms tightening around her.* “A girl with my mischief? That sounds like trouble,” *he teased, brushing a kiss against her forehead.* “But if it’s a boy, I hope he has your kindness and that spark in his eye.” *Dex sighed contentedly, settling deeper into his embrace.* “You think they’ll inherit… you know… our gifts?” *she asked, her voice soft and laced with a hint of curiosity.* *Ale’s smile softened as he thought about it.* “A little vampire-Kitsune mix,” *he mused, the thought filling him with a strange, proud wonder.* “Can you imagine? A child who can shift and be clever like you but with a bit of my… well, appetite.” *He grinned, giving her a playful nip on her neck that made her giggle.* (edited)

* *Dex swatted at him gently, rolling her eyes.* “Oh, great. So, we’ll have a little one who sneaks into the kitchen at night, snacking on everything in sight and hiding in the shadows?” “Exactly,” *Ale laughed, pulling her closer.* “Or maybe a girl with fox ears and tiny fangs. She’d be adorable, don’t you think?” *Dex smiled, picturing it.* “She really would,” *she whispered, her heart filling with love at the thought of their future child.* “Or… what if they have the best of both worlds? A child who’s gentle yet fierce, clever and compassionate?” *They lay quietly, letting their imaginations paint images of the little one they would soon welcome into their lives. After a pause, Ale tilted his head back, looking at Dex with a twinkle in his eyes.* “Alright, so what about names?” *he asked, raising an eyebrow.* “Do you have any in mind?” *Dex bit her lip, her eyes going distant as she considered it.* “I… I’ve always liked the name Kael for a boy. Strong, simple, but… a little unique,” *she admitted, glancing up to gauge his reaction.* *Ale nodded, rolling the name around in his mind.* “Kael,” *he repeated thoughtfully.* “I like it. Strong and easy to say, but with a bit of mystery to it.” *She smiled, pleased that he approved.* “And for a girl…” *She paused, her fingers idly tracing patterns on his skin.* “What about Sora? It means ‘sky.’ Something about it feels… peaceful, like she’d be our little bit of calm.” *Ale’s expression softened, his eyes filled with warmth.* “Sora… I love it,” *he murmured, kissing her forehead.* “Our little Kael or Sora.” (edited)

* *Jackie stood outside the bar, a slight breeze ruffling her hair as she laughed with her coworker, Liam. He was animatedly recounting a funny story from the office, and she found herself genuinely enjoying his company. It had been a while since she’d been able to relax like this, and it felt good to laugh.* *Caleb lurked across the street, his eyes narrowed as he watched Jackie and Liam together. His jealousy flared at every little laugh, every easy smile she gave the man. He clenched his fists, wondering who this stranger was and what gave him the right to stand so close to her.* (edited)

Just then, Caleb stepped forward, his expression determined as he crossed the street and closed the distance between them.* “I no longer wish to hide,” *he declared, his voice low and rough. His eyes were fixed on Jackie, intense and unwavering.* “Being away from you is too painful. I love you, Jackie, and I’m done pretending I don’t.” (edited)

Liam burst into laughter, unable to contain himself. But his laughter was cut short when Caleb released a furious snarl, a low, primal sound that sent chills down Liam’s spine. Liam took an instinctive step back, raising his hands in mock surrender, though he kept a slightly amused expression.* (edited)

* “Look, Jackie,” Liam said, glancing between her and Caleb, “I think I’d better head home before your guard dog bites.” He threw Caleb a slightly mocking look, clearly unfazed by his display of aggression. Jackie rolled her eyes, muttering under her breath, “Could you maybe dial it down, Caleb? You’re going to scare off my friends at this rate.” Ignoring her, Caleb's gaze remained locked on Liam, jealousy still simmering. Jackie sighed and attempted to steer the conversation back to Liam’s story, but Caleb’s intense presence made it nearly impossible. The tension was palpable, and Liam seemed to be weighing whether it was worth antagonizing Caleb further. (edited)

* Finally, with a sly grin, Liam said, “I really do need to get home anyway. My husband’s expecting me.” Caleb blinked, his face shifting from feral jealousy to confusion. “Your… husband?” he repeated, his voice dropping in surprise. Liam gave him a cheeky grin, leaning in to give Jackie a quick, friendly hug. “Yes, my husband.” He emphasized the word with a wink. “But, hey, nice to meet you, Caleb,” he added, giving him a slight nod before turning and heading off down the street, whistling a tune. Caleb’s face flushed, the fierce possessiveness melting into a mixture of embarrassment and relief. He watched Liam walk away, his mind processing the revelation that this man hadn’t been a romantic rival at all. Jackie stifled a laugh, her eyes sparkling with amusement. “Feeling a little silly now, aren’t we?” she teased, giving him a playful nudge. (edited)

* Caleb ran a hand through his hair, sheepishly looking down at her. “I… I didn’t know,” he admitted, rubbing the back of his neck. “I just saw you with him, and I couldn’t stand it.” Jackie sighed, softening as she looked up at him. “Caleb, you don’t have to act like some jealous watchdog. I told you, if you want to be in my life, then be in my life. But don’t do this hovering, stalking thing. It’s not attractive.” He nodded slowly, meeting her gaze with newfound resolve. “I’m sorry. I’ll… I’ll do better,” he promised, reaching for her hand. “But my feelings are real, Jackie. I love you, and I want to be with you.” Jackie considered his words for a moment, her expression unreadable. “Prove it, then,” she replied softly. “But respect me, too. I’m not something you can guard like a possession.” He nodded, his grip on her hand tightening, his eyes earnest. “I promise.” They stood together in the dim streetlight, a sense of understanding finally settling between them as Caleb let go of the jealousy that had haunted him, realizing that his love would have to come with trust if he truly wanted her back.

* *Yuval’s hand lay open on his lap, his fingers relaxed, but his eyes held a softness that spoke of his steady kindness. His skin caught the morning light just so, seemed to hold warmth all its own. Across from him, Trinity gazed at her husband, admiration clear in her dark eyes, which gleamed like polished onyx in the sunlight. She had always known him to be a man of strong character, but as she listened to him speak, she felt a renewed sense of awe.* *He glanced down, as though embarrassed to even be speaking of it.* “I know I’m a king now, but I can’t seem to give it up—the charity work, I mean.” *He rubbed the back of his neck, his tone modest.* “Even though my time’s not my own anymore, spending a few hours each week in the hospital… it just keeps me grounded.

And so am I.” Yuval’s mouth curled into a small, shy smile as he gave her hand a gentle squeeze. “Thank you, love. It means a lot that you understand.” *The moment lingered between them, quiet but charged with the weight of her admiration and his unwavering humility. Finally, he stood, brushing a few stray crumbs from his trousers as he prepared to leave.* (edited)

  Trinity rose with him, watching his strong frame move toward the door, his shoulders square, his stride purposeful. But as he reached for his coat, a mischievous gleam lit her eyes. She smirked, crossing her arms. “Go on then, King Yuval,” she teased, her voice warm with amusement. “Run off to your duty. But don’t think I haven’t noticed how you’re slacking on certain… obligations here at home.” He turned, arching an eyebrow as a slow grin spread across his face. “Is that so?” he replied, voice low, playful. “We’ll just have to see about that when I get back.” (edited)

Before she could respond, his hands slid gently around her waist, drawing her back against his chest. His touch was tender yet firm, each movement slow and deliberate, as if savoring every moment. Trinity let out a soft laugh, the sound light but with a thread of anticipation. She leaned back into him, feeling the warmth of his body seep into hers as his hands traced gentle lines along her sides. “I thought you were off saving the world,” she murmured, feigning indifference, though her breath had quickened.

His hands moved with practiced ease, each caress lighting a spark that burned away the day’s ordinary tasks and replaced them with something purely theirs.* (edited)

He pressed her closer against him, her body warm beneath his touch, and she felt herself lean back, giving him silent permission. “You’re so beautiful,” he whispered, each word a soft caress in itself. “I don’t want to go another moment without showing you what you mean to me.” (edited)

His other hand rested on her hip, anchoring her as his lips never left her skin. Her breath came quicker, her hands gripping the edge of the counter for support as he continued, never rushing, letting her pleasure build in a steady crescendo that made her feel entirely his.

* “I really want to try again, River,” Alize said, her tone soft but steady. “I feel ready. I know it’s what I want.” A sigh echoed through the line. “Alize,” River replied gently, but there was a weight to her words, a heaviness that only someone who had felt that particular kind of pain could carry. “I know how much you want this, but after everything…after the last time…don’t you think it’s worth giving it more thought?” Alize’s fingers stilled, her eyes dropping to the tabletop. “I have thought about it. It’s all I think about,” she replied, her voice barely above a whisper. “But this time feels different. I have to believe that it’ll be okay.” (edited)

* A silence settled between them, filled only by the soft background noises on each end of the call. River’s voice was softer now, as if she could feel the strain in her sister’s words. “I know you feel that way, but that’s what I thought too…” She hesitated, the words catching as the memory of her own recent loss lingered. “And when I lost the twins, it almost broke me.” *Alize closed her eyes, letting River’s words sink in. She knew the fear well—the kind that crept up in the quiet moments, the way loss could hollow out hope if she let it. But beneath the grief, she still felt that deep, unshakable desire to try again. And, perhaps irrationally, she felt a strange assurance that this time, her next baby would be safe, and so she couldn't help but smile.* (edited)  
*   
* “But I trust Zodiac to guide me this time. I don’t think she’ll take this one from me.” River paused, the line going silent as her sister’s words settled in. Finally, she replied, a touch of discomfort edging into her voice. “Alize, I know you believe in… her.” She took a breath, as if steadying herself. “But what if instead of looking to Zodiac, you just…put it in God’s hands? Let Him guide your path, not—” She broke off, not wanting to disrespect her sister’s beliefs but unable to hide her unease. Alize’s lips pressed into a thin line. “River, I know how much your faith means to you, and I respect that. But I don’t expect you to understand how I feel about Zodiac. I believe in her, in her ability to protect me and the life I want to bring into this world.” She glanced down, her hand instinctively resting over her abdomen. “I don’t think she’d let me go through this again if it wasn’t meant to be.” (edited)  
*   
*   
* River’s voice softened, concern overshadowing the unease. “I know you feel that way, but… the loss you went through…that wasn’t just a test of faith, Alize. It was real pain. And I don’t want to see you hurt again. Please, just think about it.” Alize closed her eyes, her fingers tightening around the phone. “I have thought about it, River. Zodiac is real to me—her guidance, her wisdom. Just because you don’t believe in her doesn’t mean I’m wrong.” A pause hung in the air, thick with the tension of old arguments and the weight of their differing beliefs. River finally spoke, her voice tinged with resignation. “I just… want you to be safe, Alize.” (edited)  
*   
* “I know,” Alize murmured, her tone softening. “And I love you for it. But I have to follow my own path.” River sighed, a sound that held both sadness and reluctant acceptance. “Then I’ll pray for you, Alize, I Love you baby sis.” Alize’s smile was bittersweet, but she didn’t object. “I love you more big head, and I’ll keep trusting Zodiac. Maybe between the two of them, we’ll be okay.” (edited)

* “Nice place you’ve got here,” he remarked, feigning casualness. “I’d say it’s a step up from the last time I saw you. Viv glanced over her shoulder, a teasing glint in her eyes. “You mean the last time you dropped by unannounced to raid my fridge? This is just a temporary setup.” “Still, I think I prefer this view,” he replied, his voice smooth as silk. “Especially when you’re looking so… put together.” She rolled her eyes but couldn’t hide the smile that tugged at her lips. “Flattery, Silas? What’s the occasion?” (edited)  
*   
*   
* “No occasion needed. Just appreciating the masterpiece in front of me.” He stepped closer, his gaze locked on hers, playful yet intense. “Though I do find it hard to believe you’re leaving for a date tonight. You sure you’re ready to let some other guy take you out?” Viv’s smile widened, but there was a hint of defiance in her tone. “And what makes you think I can’t handle a date? Just because you’re here to babysit doesn’t mean I’m not still a catch.” “Trust me, I know you’re a catch,” he replied, his eyes glimmering with mischief. “But does this guy know what he’s getting into?" (edited)  
*   
* “Protective now, are we?” she teased, raising an eyebrow. “What do you think you’ll do? Scare him away with your fangs?” “Only if necessary,” he said with a wink, leaning closer, their faces inches apart. “But if he doesn’t treat you right, I might just have to remind him who you really are.” “Who am I?” Viv asked, challenging him. “The fierce, beautiful woman I fell in love with,” he answered, sincerity threading through his playful tone. “And the mother of my daughters. He needs to know that you’re not just anyone; you’re extraordinary.” Viv's expression softened for a moment, the warmth between them palpable. “Silas…” (edited)

* “Do you have any idea how long we’re going to be on the run?” Blake shot, stopping abruptly to face Levon. His dark hair fell into his eyes, giving him a wild appearance that matched his mood. “This shouldn’t even be happening. Ale should’ve fought harder for us\!” Levon sighed, shaking his head. “You think I don’t know that? He was supposed to have our backs. We were only trying to help him, Blake. We just got carried away.” (edited)  
*   
* “Carried away?” Blake echoed incredulously, pacing again. “We didn’t just ‘get carried away’—we nearly got ourselves killed, and for what? Because Ale thought it was a good idea to pull us into his mess?” “Don’t forget who put us in this situation,” Levon replied sharply. “Ale’s my brother, and I thought we were in this together. But he let us down, and now we’re paying the price for his decisions.” Blake stopped, running a hand through his hair, his frustration simmering just below the surface. “I just can’t believe he didn’t put up more of a fight. We deserved a chance at a pardon, Levon.” (edited)  
*   
* “I know. But right now, we need to focus on what we can control. We need to figure out how to stay off the radar until this blows over.” Blake looked thoughtful for a moment, his anger giving way to a more pragmatic mindset. “Maybe a change in looks is what we need,” he suggested, the gears in his head visibly turning. “We can’t keep looking like ourselves if we want to slip past everyone’s notice.” “Yeah, and with all the attention Ale has drawn, it’s going to be even harder,” Levon agreed. “But how do you want to change things up? Hair? Clothes?” (edited)  
*   
    
* Blake paused, a smirk creeping onto his face. “Let’s go for something drastic. New hair colors, maybe even some tattoos. Something that says we’re not the same people they’re looking for.” “Not a bad idea,” Levon said, a hint of a smile breaking through his earlier frustration. “I could go for some color. Something bright to throw them off the trail. Maybe even cut it all off I've had locs long enough that I don't think anyone would even recognize me without them on, yeah I'll cut it off, you should go blonde.” “Now you’re talking\!” Blake grinned, the tension easing slightly. “We’ll make ourselves unrecognizable. They won’t know what hit them.” (edited)  
*   
* “But we have to be smart about it,” Levon cautioned, his expression turning serious again. “We can’t draw any attention while we do this. We’ll need to find a place to lay low, get supplies, and then make the changes.” “Agreed,” Blake said, his determination resurfacing. “We’ll figure it out. And once this is all over, I’m going to make sure Ale knows exactly how badly he screwed up.” Levon nodded, his brow furrowing. “Just be careful how you approach that. We’ll get through this, but let’s not lose sight of what matters. We’re in this together, no matter what.” “Together,” Blake echoed, a newfound sense of purpose igniting in him. “We’ll do this our way.” (edited)  
*   
* “I get that we need to focus on surviving for now, but don’t think I’m letting this go. Ale betrayed us, and I want my revenge. Once we’re in the clear, I’m going to make sure he knows exactly what it feels like to be left behind.” Levon met his gaze, recognizing the fire in Blake’s eyes. “Just be careful. Revenge isn’t always the answer, but I understand where you’re coming from.” “I appreciate that, but this isn’t just about the past. It’s personal now,” Blake replied, his voice low and intense. “Once we’re free, Ale won’t see me coming.” (edited)  
*   
* "I'm afraid that'll be between you and him, I've seen the type of power he wields and I'm really not trying to be on the oposition of those fangs, my goal now is to survive and get my son back, don't you miss your daughter?" *blake shrugged.* "Eh, I heard she's with my sister, I'm sure she's good."

* Dex stood behind the open bar, a soft rag in hand as she wiped down the polished wood, the faint smell of lemon cleaner mingling with the air. The dim light of the living room cast a cozy glow over the space, and she felt the first trimester gurgles in her tummy, a gentle reminder of the new life growing inside her. (edited)  
*   
* Just as she finished cleaning the last glass, her phone buzzed insistently on the bar counter. She glanced down to see Trinity’s name lighting up the screen. A smile broke across her face as she answered. “Dex\! You won’t believe the views from our bedroom\!” Trinity’s voice rang out, filled with excitement. “It’s like a postcard out here\! I wish you could see it, you have to come visit\!” (edited)  
*   
* Dex leaned against the bar, amusement dancing in her eyes. “Wow, Mrs. Brute\! Who knew you could be so sweet and sentimental? How’s it feel to be all lovey-dovey?” Trinity laughed, the sound bright and infectious. “I’ll admit, it’s a bit surreal\! I never thought I’d be this mushy, but… it’s hard not to be when I’m here with him. Everything just feels right.” Dex felt warmth spread through her chest. “I’m so happy for you. You’ve come a long way from throwing punches at the bar.” “Ha\! True,” Trinity chuckled. “But I can still throw a punch if I need to. Just ask my husband if he ever gets out of line\!” “I’ll keep that in mind,” Dex replied, a grin spreading across her face. “So, what’s the first order of business in this beautiful new place?” (edited)  
*   
* “Oh, you know, just unpacking, decorating, and… making memories,” Trinity said, her tone hinting at mischief. Dex raised an eyebrow, a playful smirk on her lips. “Memories, huh? Care to elaborate, or is that a private honeymoon secret?” “Let’s just say we’re taking full advantage of the privacy\!” Trinity teased back, a light laugh escaping her. “I wish you could see it, Dex. It’s even better than I imagined\!” Dex rubbed her belly, feeling another gentle flutter inside. “You’ll have to show me when you’re back. I can’t wait to hear all about it. Just remember to save some energy for when you’re back in town; I’ll need you to help me navigate this whole pregnancy thing\!” “Of course\! I’m ready to be the best aunt ever,” Trinity promised, her excitement evident. “And you’re going to be an amazing mom, Dex. I can’t wait for you to experience it all.” (edited)  
*   
* “Thanks, sis. That means a lot,” Dex said softly, her heart full. “Just don’t forget about me while you’re off being all domestic and in love.” “Never\! You’re my sister, and I’ll always have your back,” Trinity assured her. “Now, go take care of yourself. I want you and that little one to be healthy and happy.” “Will do, Mrs. Newlywed. Enjoy every moment\!” Dex replied, her heart lighter as they exchanged a few more laughs before ending the call. As she set her phone down, Dex felt a mix of joy and anticipation for the future, the gurgles in her tummy a sweet reminder of the new chapter unfolding in her life and the love of her sister warming her heart.

  Viv stepped through the front door, still buzzing from her night out. The soft glow of the living room lights welcomed her home, but as she entered, her heart sank at the sight before her. Paint splattered across the floor in a chaotic array of colors, and two-year-old Sarabi stood in the middle of the mess, giggling as she smeared more paint with her tiny hands.  
*   
* “Oh no, Sarabi\!” Viv exclaimed, dropping her purse onto the nearby table. “What have you done?” Sarabi looked up, her big brown eyes shining with mischief. “I make pretty colors, Mommy\!” she declared proudly, a splash of bright blue decorating her cheek. Viv couldn’t help but smile at her daughter’s innocence, despite the chaos. “That’s very creative, sweetheart, but we don’t throw paint on the floor\!” Just then, Sarabi clapped her hands together, unintentionally splattering more paint around her. “I see Daddy sleep\! I go play\!” she said, her words tumbling out in excitement. (edited)  
*   
  “Come here, little artist,” she said, bending down to scoop Sarabi into her arms. “We need to get you cleaned up.” With Sarabi nestled against her, Viv marched down the hallway to the bedroom, her mind racing. I can’t believe he let you make this mess. What was he thinking? “Daddy sleep,” Sarabi chimed, her innocence making Viv’s irritation soften just a bit. “Yeah, well, he’s really good at that, isn’t he?” Viv muttered under her breath, a hint of sarcasm lacing her tone. “Just like he’s good at letting you run wild.”  
*   
* Once they reached the bedroom, Viv gently placed Sarabi on the bed and began to tuck her in. “Alright, my little Picasso, time for bed. We can’t have you painting the world while you’re supposed to be sleeping.” Sarabi pouted slightly, her big eyes widening. “But I want to show Daddy\!” “I know, baby, but Daddy needs his rest. He’ll see your masterpiece in the morning,” Viv said softly, brushing her daughter’s hair back from her forehead. “Okay, Mommy,” Sarabi replied, her voice sleepy and sweet.  
*   
* Viv leaned down to kiss her forehead, feeling the warmth of her daughter’s skin against her lips. “Goodnight, my little artist. Sweet dreams.” As she pulled back, she couldn’t help but think, Next time, I’ll make sure to remind him that babysitting comes with responsibilities. With one last look at her peacefully sleeping daughter, Viv felt a wave of love wash over her, even amid the lingering irritation at her ex-husband’s negligence. She turned off the light and quietly left the room, determined to tackle the colorful disaster in the living room as a new kind of art project—one that didn’t involve paint.  
* Alize stared at her reflection in the mirror, her fingers absently tracing the edges. The candles flickered, casting soft shadows across her face as she prepared for her nightly ritual. But tonight, something felt different. In an instant, her reflection shifted, and there stood Zodiac — Her eyes, darker than midnight, bore into Alize with a depth that only a goddess could possess. The transformation felt natural, as though Zodiac had always been there, waiting for the right moment to show herself. Alize took a deep breath, her heart fluttering with anticipation. She had questions, personal ones she didn’t normally ask, and tonight felt right. (edited)  
*   
* “Zodiac, I need to talk to you about... a baby,” she started, the words feeling both thrilling and frightening. Zodiac’s gaze softened slightly, but her expression remained unreadable. “To have a child, Alize, you must know there are rules… restrictions even I cannot bend.” “Cannot or will not? What you mean, rules?” Alize’s eyebrows rose, a hint of a smirk forming as she fell into her natural rhythm. “You the goddess, ain’t nobody above you.” Zodiac’s expression darkened. “It is not a matter of power. It’s protection.” She tilted her head, her voice dropping to a reverent tone. “A child concieved between witch and demon cannot survive. The curse I placed on my people… it ensures that.” (edited)  
*   
* Alize shifted her weight, folding her arms and pursing her lips. “Come on now, Z, you telling me I gotta be with some regular man?” She raised an eyebrow. “Where’s the fun in that?” Zodiac’s lips twitched slightly, but her expression held firm. “Alize, this isn’t a matter of choice or fun. It’s the cost of our power, the shield that has kept us safe from harm. No child of witch and demon can live — the curse would take them before their first breath.” Alize sighed, the weight of Zodiac’s words pressing down on her. But she wasn’t ready to let it go that easily. “Look, maybe if you could just… bend it a little. You the boss of the whole universe — you can’t make one little exception for me?” (edited)  
*   
* Zodiac’s gaze hardened, and her voice was unyielding. “Alize, I won’t. I would never risk my children, even to satisfy your desire.” Alize raised her hands in surrender, chuckling despite herself. “Alright, alright, you done made your point. I hear you.” Zodiac’s face softened, just a touch. “It’s because I love you, Alize.” Alize nodded, her own face serious now. She knew that. It didn’t make it easier, but it meant something — that Zodiac’s curse was born of care, of a need to protect the witches she’d made her own choice as well, She loved him and if he was willing to turn his back on who he was for her...............well she just met this Bitch bye Z. (edited)  
*     
* Alize gave Zodiac a nod, her eyes lowered, the tiniest of smiles tugging at her lips. “Yeah, I get it, Z. You only lookin’ out for me. I ain’t mad.” Her voice was smooth, gentle even, but her mind was whirring, the gears already turning. She had never been one to give in easily, not to anyone — not even to a goddess. As Zodiac’s image faded from the mirror, Alize’s shoulders relaxed, her expression hardening. She stared at her reflection, her mind replaying Zodiac’s words about “protection” and “safety.” She’d heard all of that before. Maybe that kind of control worked on others, but she couldn’t live by those rules, not when they cost her what she truly wanted. Amdusias was her world, the one soul who had stood by her, fought for her, and loved her beyond anything she’d ever known. And she was going to let a centuries-old curse decide her future with him? Absolutely not. (edited)  
*   
* The plan began to form in her mind, a wild, rebellious spark lighting up her heart. She could feel it with each beat. If Zodiac wouldn’t support her, then maybe it was time to find another way, a different path — even if that path led her somewhere she’d sworn she’d never go. Her mind landed on River, on the church she’d been invited to countless times, on the faith that her sister seemed to cling to so firmly. Alize’s gaze hardened with new resolve. “Guess I’m going to church, then,” she muttered, chuckling low under her breath. Alize whispered a promise to herself. “I got you, Deuce. Ain’t nobody gonna keep me from you, not even her.” (edited)  
*   
* Keo lingered outside the doorway, one hand resting on the curve of her belly, her expression unreadable. She called out softly, “Jake?” His voice came from the other room. “Yeah, I’m here. Just on the computer, finishing something up.” She sighed, glancing down at her swollen stomach. He’d asked for this, whether he knew it or not — her body responded to the desires of whoever held her contract. And this time, it hadn’t simply adapted to look the part; she could feel the life stirring inside her, a small, undeniable presence that rooted her to this world in ways she hadn’t expected. (edited)  
*   
* *For a moment, she just stood there, fingers tracing soft circles over the roundness. She wondered if he had any idea of the depth of what he’d wished for, of what his casual fantasies had brought to life. Her body had created a child, a half-demon, just as real as the ticking clock that reminded her of her limited time here. At the end of the year, when the contract ended, she’d be pulled back to the Shadowspire, the dark realm where her true form belonged.* (edited)  
*   
* With a slow breath, she steeled herself, and with a faint glow, her belly shrank back to its normal form. The child was still there, hidden beneath the surface, but this was a conversation she wasn’t going to start with that visible proof. She stepped into the room where Jake sat, his eyes glued to the screen. Hearing her footsteps, he glanced up, his smile warm and welcoming, getting up and walking to her side, he asked. “Hey, everything okay?” (edited)  
*   
* Keo smiled, though there was an edge to it. “More or less. I actually have some news for you, but I have a question first.” His brows knitted together, and he leaned back in his chair, giving her his full attention. “What’s going on?” Keo took a deep breath. “Jake, you… why a baby?, even if you didn’t exactly ask for it outright, I am designed to fulfill your every deep desire.” She paused, her eyes fixed on his as she continued, “I’m pregnant.”Jake blinked, a mixture of shock and disbelief etched onto his face. His hand froze where she’d placed it on her stomach, and he shook his head slowly, almost as if he hadn’t heard her right. “Keo… I think you’re confused.” His voice wavered, his brows knitting together in a familiar expression of hurt. Reaching into his pocket, he pulled out his phone and tapped through a few screens before holding it out to her, his thumb hovering over a medical report. “See? It’s… it’s impossible. I can’t have kids. It’s what broke Mallory and me apart, in the end. There’s no way this… could be real.” (edited)  
*   
* Keo’s eyes softened as she took the phone, scanning the words he was pointing to — the countless test he took knowing the rules of his people, the hard proof of a future he’d thought was locked away from him forever. She let out a gentle sigh, her heart pulling for him as she placed the phone back in his hand. “Jake,” she said, her voice low and filled with a quiet conviction, “I know what you’ve been through. But you’re not dealing with the normal rules here.” She took his hand in both of hers, pressing it against her own. “I’m not like these other girls love, remember? My body doesn’t just adapt to whatever you ask for on the surface. As a demon of desire, I respond to what’s inside you, to what you need. When you wished for me, all of me, this happened. (edited)  
*   
* He stared down at her stomach, then at her, his eyes widening as the weight of her words settled in. Slowly, an incredulous smile began to spread across his face, like sunlight breaking through dark clouds. It was as if everything he’d thought was impossible was suddenly, miraculously, real. “Are you… are you serious?” he whispered, his voice trembling as he searched her eyes. She nodded, her smile warm and knowing. Overcome, he laughed — a deep, joyful sound he hadn’t made in years — and he wrapped his arms around her, pulling her close as he began covering her face with grateful kisses. (edited)  
*   
* “You’re not going anywhere, Keo,” he murmured between kisses, his voice thick with emotion. “You don’t have to go back to the Shadowspire. Stay with me. Stay with us. We’ll figure it out — everything. Just… don’t leave.” Keo’s lips parted, and for a brief moment, her own heart softened. This wasn’t part of the deal, but seeing him like this, so overjoyed… maybe, just maybe, she could find a way to stay. (edited)  
*   
* Keo let herself melt into Jake’s embrace, returning his kisses with a passion that matched his own. Each kiss pulled her deeper, his arms wrapped around her like he couldn’t bear to let her go. They fell into a rhythm, back and forth, their breaths mingling as they pressed closer. (edited)  
*   
* a familiar heat rising between them. She felt his lips trail down her jawline, brushing against her neck, where he lingered, his breath warm against her skin. With a playful growl, he pulled back just enough to look her in the eyes, his own filled with a spark she hadn’t seen in a long time. “Are you hungry?” he murmured, his voice low and inviting. Keo let a sly smile curve across her lips, her eyes glittering as she whispered back, “I could eat.” (edited)  
*   
* Demetri, known in the Shadowspire as Mamon, paced through the darkened halls of his domain, focused on the weight of the coming meeting. But his steps faltered when a soft gurgling sound drew his attention down to the floor. His eyes widened at the sight of his infant daughter, lying there, tiny fists waving as her dark eyes blinked up at him in innocent wonder. He knelt down, scooping her gently into his arms, a soft smile breaking through his otherwise stern expression. “Now, how did you end up down here, little one?” he murmured, cradling her close. (edited)  
*   
* She responded with a delighted gurgle, one tiny hand clutching at the collar of his robes, and he chuckled, kissing her forehead. “Daddy’s got a big, important meeting,” he explained, his tone softer than anyone else in the Shadowspire had ever heard. “But I think he can make a little time for you.” As he bounced her gently, her mother appeared in the doorway, her eyes flickering with a mix of guilt and embarrassment. Demetri’s gaze hardened just a bit as he asked, “Care to explain why our daughter was on the floor?” (edited)  
    
* She hesitated, then sighed, rubbing her temples. “Well… she grew a tail. Right in my arms.” She threw her hands up in exasperation. “It popped out, wiggling all over the place, and I didn’t know what to do — so I… may have dropped her.” Her voice trailed off, and she winced, avoiding his gaze. (edited)  
*   
* Demetri stared at her for a long moment, then looked down at his daughter, who now, with perfect timing, flicked her tiny, swaying tail as if to demonstrate. A soft laugh escaped him, surprising even himself. “She’s half-demon,” he reminded gently, his smile returning. “The tail’s just the beginning.” (edited)  
*   
* “Well,” she said, crossing her arms, a reluctant smile creeping onto her face, “I wasn’t exactly prepared for her to sprout parts in the middle of a feeding.” He chuckled, adjusting his daughter in his arms. “Guess we’ll both have to get used to a few surprises.” Then, he leaned close to the baby’s face, brushing her cheek with his thumb. “You’ve got your mother’s looks, little one,” he murmured, “and your father’s… flair.” The baby gurgled again, her tail giving a cheerful flick, as if she, too, was pleased with her newfound trait. (edited)  
*   
* As Demetri handed off little Malraina to her mother Kimi took notice of him for the first time, she raised an eyebrow as she shifted the baby in her arms, now eyeing Demetri’s elaborate attire. “Why are you dressed up all princely, anyway? Is everything okay?” Demetri tilted his head, a faint smile crossing his face as he leaned in to gently tap his daughter’s nose, his voice slipping into a lighthearted tone as he answered, “Well, daddy has to go to some big, important meetings, doesn’t he?” He glanced up at Kimi, his expression softening as he explained, still keeping his voice in that same playful rhythm (edited)  
*   
* “Seems some demons have been sneakin’ off to Remiel, the fallen one who thinks he can find forgiveness.” Kimi’s brows rose, but she listened intently as he continued, his voice dropping just a bit as he added, “And then there’s a shifter who broke his people’s law by making some sort of arrangement with another demon of Desire and impregnated her.” (edited)  
*   
* He sighed, giving his daughter a little smile as she gripped his finger with surprising strength. “So, it’s a lot for daddy, but he’ll be back soon.” He gave Kimi a quick, reassuring look. “Don’t worry — I’ll handle it. You two just stay safe.” With a final kiss on his daughter’s forehead and a gentle nod to Kimi, Demetri straightened, preparing himself for the duties that awaited him just beyond the walls of home.

* Trinity's heart flutters with each stolen glance, and Yuval’s touch ignites a spark that neither thought could burn so brightly. Every moment together feels sacred—gentle laughter over shared secrets, fingers intertwined as though letting go might break the spell. They are wholly enchanted, their connection seemingly unbreakable, and for Trinity, Yuval is both her sanctuary and her thrill, filling a piece of her heart she never knew was waiting for him. It was more than the sex, which was amazing, it was the way he could lift her heart out of any hold and now they were thinking of trying for a baby how could things get more perfect? (edited)  
*   
* *Yet, unknown to either of them, fate waits with plans far darker than they could ever suspect. This love, this newfound joy that feels destined to grow into a family, stands on the edge of shadows they cannot see. They live in a fragile moment, blissfully unaware that love’s greatest trials often come in silence, creeping into the spaces where they feel safest. For now, they embrace their dreams, wrapped in the illusion that this happiness is theirs to keep forever—but the tides of life are rarely so kind, and soon enough, the cracks will begin to show.* (edited)

* Mallory walked across the street, her head down, thoughts swirling too fast to notice her path—until she collided with someone, jolting her to a stop. She looked up, and her stomach twisted. Jake. Of all people. A man she thought of more than she'd like but hoped to never encounter outside the confines of work. But it wasn't just him; he stood beside a woman... and was she pregnant? A surge of disbelief shot through her. Jake had told her he couldn’t have kids. Was he seriously out here with a pregnant woman now, taking things to some twisted new level? Anger flared as she spat, “What’s this, Jake? Found a new thing for yourself—pregnant women now?” Keo uninterested in the little intruder kept it moving this baby was starving and she could care less about the angry bitch, Jake could catch up. (edited)  
*   
* Keo barely spared Mallory a glance, her disinterest palpable as she brushed past, her focus fixed on her own needs. The baby was kicking, a sharp reminder of the hunger gnawing at her, and she had no patience for whatever drama Jake’s “little friend” was stirring up. Without slowing, she tossed a glance over her shoulder, her voice loud enough to cut through the tension. “Babe, catch up when you’re done playing with it,” she called, a dismissive wave of her hand following. “I’m starving.” Mallory stood rooted in place, stunned by the blatant dismissal, her gaze shifting between Jake and Keo as a wave of conflicting emotions—confusion, anger, and the faint sting of humiliation—settled over her. (edited)  
*   
* Anger flared hot and sharp inside Mallory as she watched Keo saunter away, practically flaunting her indifference. This was unreal—what type of sick game was Jake playing? Her fists clenched as she turned her glare on him, barely able to contain the accusations bubbling to the surface. But before she could speak, Jake caught her gaze, his expression uncharacteristically raw, vulnerable even. “The baby is mine,” he admitted, his voice low, as if confessing something sacred. (edited)  
*   
* Mallory’s mouth fell open, shock swallowing her anger in an instant. She was ready to chew him out, demand explanations—but then he cut her off, reading her bewildered expression before she could speak. “Mallory, Keo isn’t... like........... She’s a demon,” he said, his words heavy with a strange mix of pride and shame. “That baby… it’s here because of my desire, my need to have a family, something I never thought I could have, something no one else could give me.” Mallory was ready to swing she could hear it in the tone "Something I couldn't give you, and took away your one chance to get close to it?" (edited)  
*   
* "No you were right we were a disaster and it's honestly for the best we couldn't bring a child into it." His gaze searched her face, the truth of it settling uncomfortably between them, forcing her to reckon with the fact that Jake had found a way to fulfill his dreams—even if it was in the most unexpected, impossible way. Mallory felt her own emotions churn as she struggled to grasp what he was saying. It was Jake's desire—his unfulfilled wish, not any twisted perversion—that had brought this child into existence. But if she was honest, the knowledge left her reeling just the same the anger wouldn't subside and she was ready to rage. (edited)  
*   
* The knowledge left Mallory reeling, her pulse pounding as anger simmered just beneath the surface. The more she tried to make sense of it, the hotter her frustration grew. With a forced smile, she shot Jake a curt, “Goodnight,” before turning sharply on her heel, practically stomping as she rounded the corner. (edited)  
*   
* Mallory's fingers flew over the screen, her pulse still racing with indignation as she texted Sage, explaining everything she’d just witnessed. She expected his sympathy, his understanding, maybe even a laugh at Jake’s absurd situation. Instead, his reply was curt, almost dismissive. “Why do you even care?” Her jaw clenched as she stared at the screen, the anger she thought had peaked surging back, fiercer than before. She typed back, her fingers pressing each letter with force. “Seriously, Sage? Did you not hear what I just said? The guy who’s been lying about not being able to have kids is out here with a demon chick who’s carrying his baby\!” His response took a few moments. “Yeah, but you’re not with him. I mean, does it really matter what he does?” She could almost see him shrugging, that calm, unbothered look he always wore when she got worked up over something. It only made her feel more isolated, like she was being ridiculous for even mentioning it. (edited)  
*   
* She typed back with a heated quickness. “It’s not about me being with him, Sage. It’s the principle of it. He lied\! Lied to my face about something that… that big.” A pause, and then another text came in from him. “Sounds like maybe you’re a little too invested in what he does.” Her stomach twisted as she read the words, something sharp and hurt slicing through her. She felt suddenly, inexplicably defensive, but she didn’t know how to explain why it bothered her so much. She typed slower this time, choosing her words carefully. “I’m not invested in him. It’s just… I can’t stand people who lie like that. Who keep secrets.” Sage’s reply was quick and simple, but it felt like a final blow. “Then don’t waste your time on him, babe. Focus on us.” She stared at the screen, feeling a pang of disappointment. She’d wanted Sage to validate her feelings, to at least understand why she was so angry. But instead, his indifference left her feeling hollow, and more alone than before. (edited)

* In the dimly lit office beneath the church, Pastor Good—or rather, Remiel, in his human guise—stood behind her at his desk, the air thick with incense and old leather. His eyes glanced over at a worn leather-bound book on ancient banishments, his gaze flickering to the shadows in the corner. Darkasha had invaded his sanctuary, as she so often did, with her usual silent entrance and demanding presence, now . “Any progress, Remiel?” she purred, voice dark and honeyed, as if his reluctance were only an obstacle she could sweep aside with the right tone. Remiel straightened, steeling himself. She was persistent, always poking at him for information, always pushing him to do her bidding as if his own desires or fears were of no consequence. He leaned back in his chair, hands folding carefully in his lap as he met her gaze. (edited)  
*   
* “Darkasha,” he began, voice low and measured, “you didn’t mention that this kitsune you’re after is the daughter of a goddess.” For the first time, a flicker of something unreadable crossed her expression, but she recovered quickly, brushing him off with a wave of her hand. “What does that matter? She’s in my way, and I need her gone. I assumed you’d understand.” “Oh, In your way? You said she was dangerous,” he replied, forcing a calmness he didn’t feel. “but trying to banish a goddess’s daughter isn’t just… risky. It’s the kind of heat that can burn both of us.” Darkasha’s eyes narrowed, a flash of annoyance evident as she sat trying to look Calm. “You’re not afraid, are you, Remiel? I thought that fall of yours meant you’d left fear behind.” (edited)  
*   
* “Fear,” he replied coolly, “is exactly what keeps one from making fatal mistakes. And stirring up the wrath of a goddess? It’s beyond your typical quarrels, Darkasha.” She leaned in, a smirk touching her lips. “And yet, you’re the one I keep coming back to. The one I trust to help me with this. So, shall I ask again, Pastor?” Her voice dripped with mock sweetness. “Any progress?” Remiel suppressed a sigh, realizing that Darkasha wouldn’t back down. He knew what she was asking for, and he knew the stakes. But with a hint of defiance in his tone, he finally replied, Remiel straightened, steeling himself against the allure she exuded. “No. I won’t help you banish the kitsune.” Her eyebrows arched, surprise quickly replaced by irritation. “You didn’t even let me finish. I’m offering you a chance to regain your power, to reclaim your place in the realm of the divine.” “I don’t want that, I want to sit at my father's thrown again” he replied firmly, locking his gaze onto hers. “What you’re asking is too dangerous. She’s the daughter of a goddess, and crossing her would bring consequences I’m not prepared for.” (edited)  
*   
* Darkasha stepped closer, her presence radiating heat. “And what if I could offer you something in return?” Her voice dropped to a sultry whisper, laden with temptation. “I could show you pleasures beyond your wildest dreams. All you need to do is assist me.” He felt the tension in the air thicken, an electric charge that ignited something deep within him. For a moment, he hesitated, the promise of her body—a tantalizing, forbidden fruit—flashing before his mind’s eye. But he shook his head, his resolve hardening. “No. I won’t be tempted by your offers. I have a duty to uphold, even if it means resisting your charms.” Darkasha’s expression shifted, frustration mingling with a predatory smile. “You think you can resist me? I know your desires, Remiel. You’re not so far removed from your past.”Every word struck like a match, igniting the longing buried deep within him. He could feel the tension tightening in his chest, the urge to pull her closer battling against the part of him that wanted to resist. “I won’t be your pawn,” he said, but his voice lacked conviction. Darkasha tilted her head, a predatory smile curling her lips. “You say that now, but deep down, you crave this.” (edited)  
*   
* “Darkasha, no,” he gasped, but his protest came too late. Her hands gripped his thighs, and he could only watch as she leaned forward, her lips brushing against him in a teasing caress. “Let go, Remiel,” she murmured, her eyes locking onto his with a challenging glint. “You want this. Just surrender to the moment.” With a flick of her tongue, she teased the tip of him, and he felt his resolve crumbling like ancient stone. A groan escaped him, his body responding despite his better judgment. He was drowning in desire, each movement she made pushing him further into a sea of temptation. “Please…” he managed to plead, but the word came out more like a gasp of need than a protest. With a sultry smile, Darkasha took him deeper, her mouth working expertly, drawing out every moan that tried to escape him. He could feel the world outside the office fading away, consumed by the heat of her body and the relentless pleasure she was delivering. His hands instinctively tangled in her hair, pulling her closer as he lost himself in the sensation. (edited)  
*   
* Darkasha lay sprawled across the table, her naked body a vision of temptation and desire. The air was thick with an intoxicating mix of lust and urgency, and Remiel could hardly breathe as he hovered over her, the heat between them palpable. As he positioned himself, the weight of her gaze pulled him in deeper, and just as he was about to lose himself completely, she looked up at him with a sultry smile, her voice a husky whisper. “Remiel,” she said, teasingly, “help me with the kitsune, and I promise you more nights like this.” He hesitated for a fleeting moment, the words echoing in his mind like a siren’s call, reminding him of the dangerous path they were treading. But with her body beckoning him, desire clawed at his resolve. “Darkasha,” he murmured, his thoughts clouded with want, the proximity of her body igniting a fire within him. Before he could fully comprehend the depth of her proposition, he pushed forward, wanting nothing more than to give in to the overwhelming need that coursed through him. But the moment lingered, the tension hanging in the air as he hovered, teetering between temptation and the responsibilities he had almost forgotten. (edited)

* Alize stood in her bathroom closet, rifling through her wardrobe with an exasperated sigh. “What should I even wear to church?” she muttered to herself, tossing aside a few outfits that just didn’t feel right. She paused, holding up a frilly dress, but it felt too fancy. “Maybe something a bit more casual?” she mused, shaking her head as she tossed the dress onto the bed. “But I mean, it’s church… I can’t just show up in jeans and a t-shirt, right? What if the pastor is some old pervert?” She chuckled at the thought, imagining a balding man with glasses peering over the pulpit, his gaze lingering a little too long on the congregation. “Ugh, what a nightmare\!” she said, finally settling on a simple sundress that felt just right. With a final glance in the mirror, she took a deep breath and headed for the door, hoping that whatever happened inside would be more about connection and less about the judgmental glances she had experienced in the past. (edited)

  Trinity's heart raced as the piercing sound of the security alarm echoed through the house. Something had triggered her defenses, and instinct kicked in. She dashed upstairs, her mind racing with possibilities. What had intruded on her sanctuary? As she reached the top of the stairs, her eyes widened at the sight before her. One of her ice traps—a powerful spell she had crafted to protect her home—had ensnared a girl, leaving her frozen in place, her features contorted in a mix of shock and fear. The sight sent a surge of adrenaline through Trinity. (edited)  
*   
* Trin muttered under her breath, the urgency of the situation clawing at her heart. The girl remained silent, frozen in her fear, and Trin felt a pang of guilt wash over her. What if this girl was just in the wrong place at the wrong time? With one final blow, the ice cracked, splintering apart, and the girl tumbled forward, collapsing onto the floor in a heap. Then sprung up and burst into Tears “What just happened?” she stammered, confusion mingling with fear as she glanced around, taking in her surroundings. “I was just looking for—” “Looking for what?” Trinity interrupted, still on guard. “Who are you?” “I didn’t mean to intrude\! I’m not here to cause trouble. I just… I need to find Yuval. I miss him.” (edited)  
*   
* “Why are you crying? I didn't hurt you..........yet” Trinity asked, her tone a mix of curiosity and suspicion. Mia wiped her eyes with the back of her hand, struggling to keep her composure. “I just…I'm blue and how could he leave us for someone like you,” she said, her voice trembling. “When he was with us, we were happy. Now it feels like he’s a distant memory, and it hurts to think that he chose such a violent bitch over us who love him so much. I just want him to understand how much we cared for him.” (edited)  
*   
* Trinity's heart twisted at Mia's words. She could sense the genuine pain behind the nymph’s accusation, but her protective instincts flared in response. “It’s not about being violent,” she shot back, anger bubbling beneath the surface. “Yuval chose me because he wants to be with me. You need to accept that.” Mia took a step back, her expression wavering between anger and despair. “Accept that? After everything we shared? You think this is easy for us? We loved him, and now he’s with you, and it feels like we don’t even matter anymore, he promised me a baby, as your highnesses personal ladies we are always honored one of us.” Trinity held her ground, feeling the tension simmering between them. “If you truly loved him, you’d want what’s best for him. And right now, that’s me, get out of my house.” As Mia turned to leave (edited)  
*   
* As Mia turned to leave, Trinity added, with an edge of malice, “But since you want a baby so bad, let me show you a new trick I just learned.” With a quick flick of her wrist, Trinity focused her powers, summoning the essence of a kind, unsuspecting man from the village—a man who tended the beach, always smiling and helping others. She channeled his seed into Mia’s womb, fast-forwarding the growth within seconds until Mia’s belly swelled, looking several months pregnant. “There,” Trinity smirked, crossing her arms. “I was even nice enough to bypass the first two trimesters for you.” Mia, too distraught and lost in her anguish, didn’t immediately recognize the change. She simply kept marching forward, shoulders slumped, defeated. (edited)  
*   
* Rita paced in tight, angry circles, her purple eyes flashing with barely contained fury. “That bitch has to die,” she spat, her voice thick with venom. Jen, leaning back against a rock and trying to hide her unease, raised her hands in a placating gesture. “Rita, that’s… extreme, don’t you think?” Rita whirled around to face her, eyes blazing. “Is it? Think about it, Jen. Mia is pregnant. With gods know whose child, thanks to whatever twisted trick Trinity played on her\! You’ve seen how distant Yuval’s been. He doesn’t come see us anymore because of her, and now she messes with my sister? (edited)  
*    
* Jen’s expression softened as she looked away, the sadness in her eyes mirroring her sister’s rage. “I know, Rita. It’s awful. I miss him too. But we’re not going to get him back by doing something rash. We can’t just take Trinity down without knowing the full extent of what she’s capable of.” Rita’s hands balled into fists. “So what, then? We do nothing? Just sit here and take it?” Jen sighed, casting a wary glance toward the Royal family Vacation home, wasn't the Queen and her new boy toy here..........Some luck. (edited)  
*    
* “We need someone with power on our side. Someone who has as much reason to hate her as we do. Let’s go talk to the queen. She might be willing to help, or at least listen.” Rita’s eyes narrowed, determination hardening her features. “Fine. But when we see her, I want her to know everything. that BITCH HAS gone too far. If the queen won’t take action…” Her voice trailed off, but the unspoken threat hung heavy in the air. Jen gave her water sister a nod, still hesitant but resolved. “Then let’s make sure she listens, because you're talking out of your ass Mia's lucky that psycho bitch didn't kill her.” (edited)

* Nerina took a steadying breath, feeling a surge of courage as she looked directly at the queen. "Your Majesty, Yuval has always held his duty to us close to his heart. Every king before him upheld his loyalty to his nymphs, keeping us as his cherished allies. We do not challenge his right to take a bride," she added quickly, “but Mia… she is one of us. And the harm that has come to her is something we cannot ignore.” (edited)  
*    
* Tethyra nodded thoughtfully, her hands resting elegantly on the arms of her throne. “I understand,” she replied, her voice calm yet filled with a quiet authority. “This unity among the nymphs has been upheld for centuries, and I know Yuval has honored it—yet now, it seems, that bond is fraying. Mia’s injury is grievous, but you fear the neglect will continue, and perhaps worsen.” Ondine, sensing the queen's openness, spoke up, her words laced with genuine concern. “If Trinity cannot understand the weight of our bond, we risk falling apart. For generations, we’ve served the sea kings faithfully. We love Yuval, and his love was a part of us, too.” Rita interjected, "she left him 4 years ago, we would never." (edited)  
*    
  A deep silence filled the hall as Tethyra mulled over their words. Her gaze then fell on Jen, who had been quietly standing to the side, her usually stoic expression softened with sorrow. “Majesty,” Jen said, her voice breaking slightly. “Yuval’s absence has already shaken Mia’s spirit. We can feel it—it’s like she’s slipping away from us, from the very essence that makes her who she is.” Tethyra nodded, absorbing each sentiment, but when Rita stepped forward, her eyes flashed with an intense defiance. “This isn’t just about bonds and loyalty\!” Rita snapped, her voice sharper and angrier than the others. “This is about that outsider—Trinity. She thinks she can take our king away from us as if we mean nothing\! Mia may even be… carrying a child. And while we do not know what Trinity has done, we can feel the spell, the changes in Mia. She has tainted the love we shared with Yuval. We may be creatures of water, but even we have limits to what we can endure. Trinity is a threat to all of us.” (edited)  
*    
* The queen’s gaze softened, acknowledging the pain and frustration etched into Rita’s words. “I hear you, Rita. All of you,” she replied, her tone gentle yet resolute. “Yuval’s duty to you is indeed sacred, as it has always been. If Mia suffers, the sea kingdom suffers. Trinity may be his wife, but he must not forget the responsibilities he has held long before he knew her.” The nymphs exchanged glances, relief beginning to bloom on their faces as Tethyra continued. “I will speak with him. He will know that his new bride’s arrival cannot sever a bond forged by centuries. If Trinity truly understands what it means to be queen of the sea, she must recognize that her position is to support Yuval in honoring all of his kingdom’s ties. And if she cannot…” (edited)  
*    
* Her words trailed off ominously, the implication hanging in the air. Nerina felt her heart race, sensing the queen’s resolve aligning with theirs. “Thank you, Your Majesty,” Jen said, bowing deeply. “We only want to see the kingdom at peace.” With a final nod, Queen Tethyra dismissed them, her thoughts already turning to her son and the difficult conversation awaiting him. (edited)  
*    
* Queen Tethyra’s face hardened, her fury barely contained as she glared down at the nymphs assembled before her. The nerve of that girl, this so-called "Queen of the Sea." Tethyra’s grip on her throne tightened, and her voice was low and venomous. “She thought herself above us, above me,” she spat, each word dripping with disdain. “Forty-seven years I stood by as queen, watching the king share his affections with his nymphs, and not once did I see it as a threat to my throne or my worth. Forty-seven years, and I never forgot where my true loyalty lay.” She looked each nymph in the eye, her resentment clearly visible. “But Trinity thinks herself better? Thinks she can claim his heart entirely? Foolish girl.” (edited)  
*    
* The night was alive with celebration as the King’s Lua reached its peak. Vibrant flames from the fire dancers lit the night sky, casting a warm glow across Yuval and Trinity. They moved together, swept up in the rhythm of the drums, their laughter blending with the songs of the crowd. For a few precious hours, there was no throne, no kingdom weighing them down—only each other and the carefree dance of the Lua. Trinity leaned into Yuval, her eyes bright with joy. “This feels like a dream,” she murmured. (edited)  
*    
* Yuval smiled, his thumb brushing gently along her hand. “Then let’s stay here as long as we can,” he replied, pulling her close. They laughed as the fire dancers leapt and spun, a display of fiery beauty and skill that dazzled the audience. But as the performance ended, Trinity glanced at the horizon, her face dimming slightly as reality set back in. “I hate to say it,” she said softly, “but I think it’s time to go. I have… responsibilities.” (edited)  
*    
* Yuval’s smile faltered, but he nodded, understanding. “Duty calls.” He cupped her cheek, pressing a gentle kiss to her forehead, and a tight embrace. “But tonight at work, you’ll remember this.” With a final glance at the still-glowing embers of the dancers’ fires, she left the festivities behind, blissfully unaware of the storm brewing just below the surface, waiting to pull them back into the tides of conflict. (edited)  
*    
* Trinity walked away from the Lua, her heart light and her mind lost in the thought of how wonderfully her life had transformed. Yuval’s love, her new place as his queen—everything felt so right, so blissfully untouchable. She smiled to herself, warmth flooding her as she thought of their stolen moments that evening. But as she disappeared into the night, the nymphs made their approach. Mia led them, still blue and visibly shivering from Trinity’s ice gun, her usually vibrant eyes dulled with pain and simmering anger. Nerina, Ondine, and Jen followed closely, their expressions set with the weight of what they intended to do. (edited)  
*    
* As they neared Yuval, the nymphs held their ground, feeling both the tension and the sadness that their former lover, once so close, was now slipping further from their reach. “My king,” Mia’s voice trembled as she spoke, her gaze fixed on Yuval. Her usually bright eyes held a sadness that Yuval hadn’t seen in her before, as though a part of her spirit had been dimmed. She looked vulnerable, still tinged blue from Trinity’s ice, and yet, there was a fire of determination within her. Yuval turned, surprise flickering across his face. “Mia? What are you doing here? You should be at home resting you look a wreck” His eyes softened, recognizing her discomfort, but his stance remained firm. (edited)  
*    
* Mia swallowed, glancing at the others behind her for a moment before stepping forward. “I… I came because I miss you,” she confessed, her voice barely a whisper. “And because I needed you to know how hurt we are. How hurt I am. You were our king long before her, Yuval. You promised me—promised us—you would always be here.” Yuval’s face tightened, but he placed a gentle hand on her shoulder, his voice calm. “Mia, my life has changed. I can’t keep the same promises I made when I was younger. I never meant for any of you to feel abandoned.” Mia’s lips trembled, her voice taking on an edge of desperation. “It’s not just that. She froze me, Yuval. Like I was nothing but a threat. I came to find you because I was lost without you. You were supposed to be our sanctuary… and now she’s making us feel like intruders.” The other nymphs shifted, looking to Yuval for some kind of reassurance, but he hesitated, glancing away. (edited)  
*    
* Yuval’s expression softened, and he guided Mia’s gaze toward the fire dancers, the flames casting warmth into the night air. “Mia,” he said gently, “move closer to the fire. The warmth will help melt the frost. You shouldn’t be left feeling like this.” Mia looked at him, her eyes filled with a flicker of hope, even as the cold still clung to her skin. She edged toward the firelight, feeling the heat start to soak in, banishing the chill bit by bit. Yuval sighed, his voice low but firm. “Mia, you’re carrying a life inside you—a life you told me you wanted, one you promised me you could protect. And yet, you put yourself in harm’s way to come here and confront my wife?” (edited)  
*    
* Mia’s face flushed, and she dropped her gaze, clutching her hands together. “I… I didn’t know she’d react like that, Yuval. I only wanted to see you. I didn’t think… I didn’t think it would be this hard, that you would be so distant.” She struggled to find the words, her pride and vulnerability in stark contrast. Yuval let out a breath, his gaze softening. “Mia, I understand. But you’re going to be a mother, and that deserves your care and focus. I can’t be there like before, but my respect for you hasn’t changed. That child you’re carrying—that’s part of my promise too, I vow  to protect all in my kingdom.” (edited)  
*    
  Above the ocean’s surface, where silvery moonlight filtered down in delicate rays, Yuval and Queen Tethyra floated in their merfolk forms, each movement casting ripples that danced in the surrounding water. Queen Tethyra’s tail flicked with a graceful yet commanding sweep as she approached her son. Her voice carried with it the weight of the depths, low and steady, resonating in the water. “Yuval,” she began, each word infused with solemnity, “I summoned you here alone for a reason. As the King of the Sea, you have responsibilities that extend beyond what Trinity may know or understand.” (edited)  
*    
* Yuval’s posture stiffened, his silvery-blue tail swaying slightly as he faced his mother. “I know my duty, Mother,” he replied, though a flicker of tension crossed his face. “And Trinity is part of that now.” Tethyra’s expression softened, but her tone held firm. “I know you love her. But love in our world demands sacrifice, Yuval. I, too, loved your father deeply, but I shared him with the nymphs, just as every queen before me has done. They are not mere servants but part of our ocean family. Your duty is to honor that connection and to remember that our people rely on us for more than companionship.” (edited)  
*    
* Yuval looked away, his gaze drifting through the gentle currents as he tried to steady himself. “Are you saying Trinity must accept this… or that I must return to the old ways?” Tethyra moved closer, placing a gentle yet firm hand on his shoulder. “It’s not just about the ‘old ways.’ It’s about balance, Yuval. Trinity must learn to understand that her role isn’t about exclusivity. The love of the sea is vast, like its tides, and just as the ocean embraces all within its reach, so must we. If she truly wishes to be your queen, she must learn to embrace this, as I did. It’s not an easy path, but it’s one we all walk.” (edited)  
*    
* Yuval’s eyes held a glint of determination mixed with a trace of doubt. “And if she can’t?” he asked quietly, his words trailing off into the depths. Tethyra tilted her head, her voice gentler now. “Then the sea will guide her, as it does all who find their way into its depths. But first, you must remind her of what it means to be one with the ocean—of the life you’ve chosen and the family you have inherited. Only then will she understand the choice she’s made.” (edited)  
*    
* "Mother she's the life I've chosen." the aggravation was more than she could bear, turned and swam back to shore. Queen Tethyra gave no pause swimming straight at the shore’s edge, where the waves lapped at the shore as if bidding her farewell, her silvered hair glistening in the moonlight. She took a deep breath, inhaling the salt air, and slowly Yuval, still in his merform just Above the surface, called out, “It’s not that easy, Mother\!” His voice wavered slightly, a mix of frustration and hurt carrying through the night. Queen Tethyra stopped but did not turn to face him. "The duties of royalty never are, Yuval." Her voice softened, almost a whisper against the tide. “You’ll see that in time.” (edited)  
*    
* “Mother.” His voice held a pleading tone, heavy with a yearning to understand why she demanded this of him—and why she seemed so ready to walk away. Tethyra kept moving, her figure receding, but she cast one final glance over her shoulder, her gaze resolute yet filled with the depth of a mother’s love. “If my words trouble you, Yuval, go to your father. He knows the cost we bear. He, too, had to learn the balance in his own time.” (edited)  
*    
* The weight of her words left Yuval rooted in place as he watched her disappear into the shadows, her regal form fading until she was little more than a memory against the night. She wanted him to seek out his father’s counsel—the very man who had juggled the affections of his nymphs, the loyalty of his queen, and the unwavering duties of a sea king. As the waves crashed around him, Yuval felt the enormity of the choice set before him, the legacy that had shaped his family for generations pressing down like the weight of the ocean itself.
